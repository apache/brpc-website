&lt;h1 id="what-is-rpc">What is RPC?&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Most machines on internet communicate with each other via &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite">TCP/IP&lt;/a>. However, TCP/IP only guarantees reliable data transmissions. We need to abstract more to build services:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>What is the format of data transmission? Different machines and networks may have different byte-orders, directly sending in-memory data is not suitable. Fields in the data are added, modified or removed gradually, how do newer services talk with older services?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Can TCP connection be reused for multiple requests to reduce overhead? Can multiple requests be sent through one TCP connection simultaneously?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>How to talk with a cluster with many machines?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What should I do when the connection is broken? What if the server does not respond?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&amp;hellip;&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_procedure_call">RPC&lt;/a> addresses the above issues by abstracting network communications as &amp;ldquo;clients accessing functions on servers&amp;rdquo;: client sends a request to server, wait until server receives -&amp;gt; processes -&amp;gt; responds to the request, then do actions according to the result.
&lt;img src="https://brpc.apache.org/images/docs/rpc.png" alt="rpc.png">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s see how the issues are solved.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>RPC needs serialization which is done by &lt;a href="https://github.com/google/protobuf">protobuf&lt;/a> pretty well. Users fill requests in format of protobuf::Message, do RPC, and fetch results from responses in protobuf::Message. protobuf has good forward and backward compatibility for users to change fields and build services incrementally. For http services, &lt;a href="http://www.json.org/">json&lt;/a> is used for serialization extensively.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Establishment and re-using of connections is transparent to users, but users can make choices like &lt;a href="../client/basics/#connection-type">different connection types&lt;/a>: short, pooled, single.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Machines are discovered by a Naming Service, which can be implemented by &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System">DNS&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://zookeeper.apache.org/">ZooKeeper&lt;/a> or &lt;a href="https://github.com/coreos/etcd">etcd&lt;/a>. Inside Baidu, we use BNS (Baidu Naming Service). brpc provides &lt;a href="../client/basics/#naming-service">&amp;ldquo;list://&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;file://&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a> as well. Users specify load balancing algorithms to choose one machine for each request from all machines, including: round-robin, randomized, &lt;a href="../rpc-in-depth/consistent-hashing/">consistent-hashing&lt;/a>(murmurhash3 or md5) and &lt;a href="../rpc-in-depth/locality-aware/">locality-aware&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>RPC retries when the connection is broken. When server does not respond within the given time, client fails with a timeout error.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h1 id="where-can-i-use-rpc">Where can I use RPC?&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Almost all network communications.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>RPC can&amp;rsquo;t do everything surely, otherwise we don&amp;rsquo;t need the layer of TCP/IP. But in most network communications, RPC meets requirements and isolates the underlying details.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Common doubts on RPC:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>My data is binary and large, using protobuf will be slow. First, this is possibly a wrong feeling and you will have to test it and prove it with &lt;a href="../builtin-services/cpu_profiler/">profilers&lt;/a>. Second, many protocols support carrying binary data along with protobuf requests and bypass the serialization.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I&amp;rsquo;m sending streaming data which can&amp;rsquo;t be processed by RPC. Actually many protocols in RPC can handle streaming data, including &lt;a href="../client/access-httph2/#progressively-download">ProgressiveReader in http&lt;/a>, streams in h2, &lt;a href="../client/streaming-rpc/">streaming rpc&lt;/a>, and RTMP which is a specialized streaming protocol.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I don&amp;rsquo;t need replies. With some inductions, we know that in your scenario requests can be dropped at any stage because the client is always unaware of the situation. Are you really sure this is acceptable? Even if you don&amp;rsquo;t need the reply, we recommend sending back small-sized replies, which are unlikely to be performance bottlenecks and will probably provide valuable clues when debugging complex bugs.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h1 id="what-is-brpcimagesdocslogopng">What is &lt;img src="https://brpc.apache.org/images/docs/logo.png" alt="brpc">?&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>brpc is an Industrial-grade RPC framework using C++ Language, which is often used in high performance system such as Search, Storage, Machine learning, Advertisement, Recommendation etc.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can use it to:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Build a server that can talk in multiple protocols (&lt;strong>on same port&lt;/strong>), or access all sorts of services
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>restful http/https, &lt;a href="https://http2.github.io/http2-spec">h2&lt;/a>/&lt;a href="https://grpc.io">gRPC&lt;/a>. using http/h2 in brpc is much more friendly than &lt;a href="https://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/">libcurl&lt;/a>. Access protobuf-based protocols with HTTP/h2+json, probably from another language.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="../client/access-redis/">redis&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="../client/access-memcached/">memcached&lt;/a>, thread-safe, more friendly and performant than the official clients&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://github.com/brpc/brpc/blob/master/src/brpc/rtmp.h">rtmp&lt;/a>/&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_Video">flv&lt;/a>/&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Live_Streaming">hls&lt;/a>, for building &lt;a href="https://github.com/brpc/media-server">streaming services&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>hadoop_rpc (may be opensourced)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_direct_memory_access">rdma&lt;/a> support (will be opensourced)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="../client/access-thrift/">thrift&lt;/a> support, thread-safe, more friendly and performant than the official clients.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>all sorts of protocols used in Baidu: &lt;a href="https://github.com/apache/brpc/blob/master/docs/cn/baidu_std.md">baidu_std&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="../client/streaming-rpc/">streaming_rpc&lt;/a>, hulu_pbrpc, &lt;a href="https://github.com/baidu/sofa-pbrpc">sofa_pbrpc&lt;/a>, nova_pbrpc, public_pbrpc, ubrpc, and nshead-based ones.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Build &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_availability">HA&lt;/a> distributed services using an industrial-grade implementation of &lt;a href="https://raft.github.io">RAFT consensus algorithm&lt;/a> which is opensourced at &lt;a href="https://github.com/brpc/braft">braft&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Servers can handle requests &lt;a href="../server/basics/">synchronously&lt;/a> or &lt;a href="../server/basics/#asynchronous-service">asynchronously&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Clients can access servers &lt;a href="../client/basics/#synchronus-call">synchronously&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="../client/basics/#asynchronous-call">asynchronously&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="../client/basics/#semi-synchronous-call">semi-synchronously&lt;/a>, or use &lt;a href="../client/combo-channels/">combo channels&lt;/a> to simplify sharded or parallel accesses declaratively.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Debug services &lt;a href="../builtin-services/buildin_services/">via http&lt;/a>, and run &lt;a href="../builtin-services/cpu_profiler/">cpu&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="../builtin-services/heap_profiler/">heap&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="../builtin-services/contention_profiler/">contention&lt;/a> profilers.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Get &lt;a href="#better-latency-and-throughput">better latency and throughput&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="../rpc-in-depth/new-protocol/">Extend brpc&lt;/a> with the protocols used in your organization quickly, or customize components, including &lt;a href="../rpc-in-depth/load-balancing/#%E5%91%BD%E5%90%8D%E6%9C%8D%E5%8A%A1">naming services&lt;/a> (dns, zk, etcd), &lt;a href="../rpc-in-depth/load-balancing/#%E8%B4%9F%E8%BD%BD%E5%9D%87%E8%A1%A1">load balancers&lt;/a> (rr, random, consistent hashing)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h1 id="advantages-of-brpc">Advantages of bRPC&lt;/h1>
&lt;h3 id="more-friendly-api">More friendly API&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Only 3 (major) user headers: &lt;a href="https://github.com/brpc/brpc/blob/master/src/brpc/server.h">Server&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://github.com/brpc/brpc/blob/master/src/brpc/channel.h">Channel&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://github.com/brpc/brpc/blob/master/src/brpc/controller.h">Controller&lt;/a>, corresponding to server-side, client-side and parameter-set respectively. You don&amp;rsquo;t have to worry about &amp;ldquo;How to initialize XXXManager&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;How to layer all these components together&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s the relationship between XXXController and XXXContext&amp;rdquo;. All you need to do is simple:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Build service? include &lt;a href="https://github.com/brpc/brpc/blob/master/src/brpc/server.h">brpc/server.h&lt;/a> and follow the comments or &lt;a href="https://github.com/brpc/brpc/blob/master/example/echo_c++/server.cpp">examples&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Access service? include &lt;a href="https://github.com/brpc/brpc/blob/master/src/brpc/channel.h">brpc/channel.h&lt;/a> and follow the comments or &lt;a href="https://github.com/brpc/brpc/blob/master/example/echo_c++/client.cpp">examples&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Tweak parameters? Checkout &lt;a href="https://github.com/brpc/brpc/blob/master/src/brpc/controller.h">brpc/controller.h&lt;/a>. Note that the class is shared by server and channel. Methods are separated into 3 parts: client-side, server-side and both-side.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>We tried to make simple things simple. Take naming service as an example. In older RPC implementations you may need to copy a pile of obscure code to make it work, however, in brpc accessing BNS is expressed as &lt;code>Init(&amp;quot;bns://node-name&amp;quot;, ...)&lt;/code>, DNS is &lt;code>Init(&amp;quot;http://domain-name&amp;quot;, ...)&lt;/code> and local machine list is &lt;code>Init(&amp;quot;file:///home/work/server.list&amp;quot;, ...)&lt;/code>. Without any explanation, you know what it means.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="make-services-more-reliable">Make services more reliable&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>brpc is extensively used in Baidu:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>map-reduce service &amp;amp; table storages&lt;/li>
&lt;li>high-performance computing &amp;amp; model training&lt;/li>
&lt;li>all sorts of indexing &amp;amp; ranking servers&lt;/li>
&lt;li>….&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s been proven.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>brpc pays special attentions to development and maintenance efficency, you can &lt;a href="../builtin-services/buildin_services/">view internal status of servers&lt;/a> in web browser or with curl, analyze &lt;a href="../builtin-services/cpu_profiler/">cpu hotspots&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="../builtin-services/heap_profiler/">heap allocations&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="../builtin-services/contention_profiler/">lock contentions&lt;/a> of online services, measure stats by &lt;a href="../bvar/bvar/">bvar&lt;/a> which is viewable in &lt;a href="../builtin-services/vars/">/vars&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="better-latency-and-throughput">Better latency and throughput&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Although almost all RPC implementations claim that they&amp;rsquo;re &amp;ldquo;high-performant&amp;rdquo;, the numbers are probably just numbers. Being really high-performant in different scenarios is difficult. To unify communication infra inside Baidu, brpc goes much deeper at performance than other implementations.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Reading and parsing requests from different clients is fully parallelized and users don&amp;rsquo;t need to distinguish between &amp;ldquo;IO-threads&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Processing-threads&amp;rdquo;. Other implementations probably have &amp;ldquo;IO-threads&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Processing-threads&amp;rdquo; and hash file descriptors(fd) into IO-threads. When a IO-thread handles one of its fds, other fds in the thread can&amp;rsquo;t be handled. If a message is large, other fds are significantly delayed. Although different IO-threads run in parallel, you won&amp;rsquo;t have many IO-threads since they don&amp;rsquo;t have too much to do generally except reading/parsing from fds. If you have 10 IO-threads, one fd may affect 10% of all fds, which is unacceptable to industrial online services (requiring 99.99% availability). The problem will be worse when fds are distributed unevenly accross IO-threads (unfortunately common), or the service is multi-tenancy (common in cloud services). In brpc, reading from different fds is parallelized and even processing different messages from one fd is parallelized as well. Parsing a large message does not block other messages from the same fd, not to mention other fds. More details can be found &lt;a href="../rpc-in-depth/io/#receiving-messages">here&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Writing into one fd and multiple fds is highly concurrent. When multiple threads write into the same fd (common for multiplexed connections), the first thread directly writes in-place and other threads submit their write requests in &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-blocking_algorithm#Wait-freedom">wait-free&lt;/a> manner. One fd can be written into 5,000,000 16-byte messages per second by a couple of highly-contended threads. More details can be found &lt;a href="../rpc-in-depth/io/#sending-messages">here&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Minimal locks. High-QPS services can utilize all CPU power on the machine. For example, &lt;a href="../rpc-in-depth/memory-management/">creating bthreads&lt;/a> for processing requests, &lt;a href="../rpc-in-depth/timer-keeping/">setting up timeout&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="../rpc-in-depth/bthread_id/">finding RPC contexts&lt;/a> according to response, &lt;a href="../bvar/bvar/">recording performance counters&lt;/a> are all highly concurrent. Users see very few contentions (via &lt;a href="../builtin-services/contention_profiler/">contention profiler&lt;/a>) caused by RPC framework even if the service runs at 500,000+ QPS.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Server adjusts thread number according to load. Traditional implementations set number of threads according to latency to avoid limiting the throughput. brpc creates a new &lt;a href="../bthread/bthread/">bthread&lt;/a> for each request and ends the bthread when the request is done, which automatically adjusts thread number according to load.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Check &lt;a href="../benchmark/">benchmark&lt;/a> for a comparison between brpc and other implementations.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Docs: Community</title><link>https://brpc.apache.org/docs/community/community/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://brpc.apache.org/docs/community/community/</guid><description>

&lt;p>If you meet any problem or request a new feature, you&amp;rsquo;re welcome to &lt;a href="https://github.com/brpc/brpc/issues/new/choose">create an issue&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you can solve any of &lt;a href="https://github.com/brpc/brpc/issues">the issues&lt;/a>, you&amp;rsquo;re welcome to send the PR to us.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Before the PR:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Fully comply with the &lt;a href="https://www.apache.org/foundation/policies/conduct.html">ASF Code of Conduct&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Make sure your code style conforms to &lt;a href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html">google C++ coding style&lt;/a>. Indentation is preferred to be 4 spaces.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The code appears where it should be. For example the code to support an extra protocol should not be put in general classes like server.cpp, channel.cpp, while a general modification would better not be hidden inside a very specific protocol.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Has unittests.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>After the PR:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Make sure the &lt;a href="https://app.travis-ci.com/github/apache/brpc/pull_requests">travis-ci&lt;/a> passed.&lt;/li>

&lt;p>brpc prefers static linkages of deps, so that they don&amp;rsquo;t have to be installed on every machine running the app.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>brpc depends on following packages:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>

&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://github.com/google/protobuf">protobuf&lt;/a>: Serializations of messages, interfaces of services.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://github.com/google/leveldb">leveldb&lt;/a>: Required by &lt;a href="../builtin-services/rpcz/">/rpcz&lt;/a> to record RPCs for tracing.&lt;/li>

&lt;h4 id="tcmalloc-17-25">tcmalloc: 1.7-2.5&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>brpc does &lt;strong>not&lt;/strong> link &lt;a href="http://goog-perftools.sourceforge.net/doc/tcmalloc.html">tcmalloc&lt;/a> by default. Users link tcmalloc on-demand.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Comparing to ptmalloc embedded in glibc, tcmalloc often improves performance. However different versions of tcmalloc may behave really differently. For example, tcmalloc 2.1 may make multi-threaded examples in brpc perform significantly worse(due to a spinlock in tcmalloc) than the one using tcmalloc 1.7 and 2.5. Even different minor versions may differ. When you program behave unexpectedly, remove tcmalloc or try another version.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Code compiled with gcc 4.8.2 and linked to a tcmalloc compiled with earlier GCC may crash or deadlock before main(), E.g:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://brpc.apache.org/images/docs/tcmalloc_stuck.png" alt="img">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When you meet the issue, compile tcmalloc with the same GCC.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another common issue with tcmalloc is that it does not return memory to system as early as ptmalloc. So when there&amp;rsquo;s an invalid memory access, the program may not crash directly, instead it crashes at a unrelated place, or even not crash. When you program has weird memory issues, try removing tcmalloc.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you want to use &lt;a href="../builtin-services/cpu_profiler">cpu profiler&lt;/a> or &lt;a href="../builtin-services/heap_profiler">heap profiler&lt;/a>, do link &lt;code>libtcmalloc_and_profiler.a&lt;/code>. These two profilers are based on tcmalloc. &lt;a href="../builtin-services/contention_profiler">contention profiler&lt;/a> does not require tcmalloc.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When you remove tcmalloc, not only remove the linkage with tcmalloc but also the macro &lt;code>-DBRPC_ENABLE_CPU_PROFILER&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="glog-33">glog: 3.3+&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>brpc implements a default &lt;a href="../../src/butil/logging.h">logging utility&lt;/a> which conflicts with glog. To replace this with glog, add &lt;code>--with-glog&lt;/code> to config_brpc.sh or add &lt;code>-DWITH_GLOG=ON&lt;/code> to cmake.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="valgrind-38">valgrind: 3.8+&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>brpc detects valgrind automatically (and registers stacks of bthread). Older valgrind(say 3.2) is not supported.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="thrift-093-0110">thrift: 0.9.3-0.11.0&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>no known issues.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="track-instances">Track instances&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We provide a program to help you to track and monitor all brpc instances. Just run &lt;a href="https://github.com/brpc/brpc/tree/master/tools/trackme_server/">trackme_server&lt;/a> somewhere and launch need-to-be-tracked instances with -trackme_server=SERVER. The trackme_server will receive pings from instances periodically and print logs when it does. You can aggregate instance addresses from the log and call builtin services of the instances for further information.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Docs: Committer Guide</title><link>https://brpc.apache.org/docs/community/committer/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://brpc.apache.org/docs/community/committer/</guid><description>
&lt;h1 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Participants in the Apache community have the following roles: &lt;strong>Contributor&lt;/strong>, &lt;strong>Committer&lt;/strong>, and &lt;strong>PMC(Project Member Committee) member&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When an individual contribution is accepted by the project, he/she will automatically become a Contributor.
Committer and PMC members are invited by the PMC after a consensus vote.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here we will only discuss some guidelines for the bRPC community to invite Committer and PMC member in order to be able to effectively estimate developer participation in the community.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="the-apache-way">The Apache Way:&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Before anyone can become a Committer or PMC member of an Apache project, they should first understand &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="https://apache.org/theapacheway/index.html">What&amp;rsquo;s TheApacheWay&lt;/a>&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="guidance-for-committer">Guidance for Committer:&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Have significant feature contributions (not limited to code), or long-term participation in community building (bug fixing, code review, documentation translation and proofreading, community outreach, etc.)
Participate in community discussions in public domain and have a positive impact.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="guidance-for-pmc-member">Guidance for PMC member:&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Be able to actively participate in community maintenance work, such as answering emails, organizing wiki, release management, code review, etc.
Recognize the Apache community philosophy and be able to actively promote the community development.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="peer-review">Peer Review:&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The above requirements are highly subjective and cannot be measured quantitatively. Therefore, the PMC needs to form a regular review mechanism to discuss and invite people who meet the requirements.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Conduct a review every 1-2 months to nominate and discuss suitable candidates&lt;/p>

The personal information entry (except for the signature) can be filled in with a PDF reader or browser, and then saved for signature. Signature method support:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Print pdf documents and scan them into electronic version after handwritten signature;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Electronic signature using devices that support handwriting;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Use &amp;lsquo;gpg&amp;rsquo; for electronic signature, that is, to operate the pdf file filled with personal basic information (a public key/key pair matching the registered mailbox needs to be generated in advance): &amp;lsquo;gpg &amp;ndash; armor &amp;ndash; detach sign icla. pdf&amp;rsquo;;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Use &amp;lsquo;DocuSign&amp;rsquo; to sign;&lt;/li>

&lt;h1 id="序言">序言&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>在多核的前提下，性能和线程是紧密联系在一起的。线程间的跳转对高频IO操作的性能有决定性作用: 一次跳转意味着至少3-20微秒的延时，由于每个核心的L1 cache独立（我们的cpu L2 cache也是独立的），随之而来是大量的cache miss，一些变量的读取、写入延时会从纳秒级上升几百倍至微秒级: 等待cpu把对应的cacheline同步过来。有时这带来了一个出乎意料的结果，当每次的处理都很简短时，一个多线程程序未必比一个单线程程序更快。因为前者可能在每次付出了大的切换代价后只做了一点点“正事”，而后者在不停地做“正事”。不过单线程也是有代价的，它工作良好的前提是“正事”都很快，否则一旦某次变慢就使后续的所有“正事”都被延迟了。在一些处理时间普遍较短的程序中，使用（多个不相交的）单线程能最大程度地”做正事“，由于每个请求的处理时间确定，延时表现也很稳定，各种http server正是这样。但我们的检索服务要做的事情可就复杂多了，有大量的后端服务需要访问，广泛存在的长尾请求使每次处理的时间无法确定，排序策略也越来越复杂。如果还是使用（多个不相交的）单线程的话，一次难以预计的性能抖动，或是一个大请求可能导致后续一堆请求被延迟。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>为了避免请求之间相互影响，请求级的线程跳转是brpc必须付出的代价，我们能做的是使&lt;a href="../rpc-in-depth/io#the-full-picture">线程跳转最优化&lt;/a>。不过，对服务的性能测试还不能很好地体现这点。测试中的处理往往极为简单，使得线程切换的影响空前巨大，通过控制多线程和单线程处理的比例，我们可以把一个测试服务的qps从100万到500万操纵自如（同机），这损伤了性能测试结果的可信度。要知道，真实的服务并不是在累加一个数字，或者echo一个字符串，一个qps几百万的echo程序没有指导意义。鉴于此，在发起性能测试一年后（15年底），在brpc又经历了1200多次改动后，我们需要review所有的测试，加强其中的线程因素，以获得对真实场景有明确意义的结果。具体来说:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>请求不应等长，要有长尾。这能考察RPC能否让请求并发，否则一个慢请求会影响大量后续请求。&lt;/li>
&lt;li>要有多级server的场景。server内用client访问下游server，这能考察server和client的综合表现。&lt;/li>
&lt;li>要有一个client访问多个server的场景。这能考察负载均衡是否足够并发，真实场景中很少一个client只访问一个server。&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>我们希望这套测试场景对其他服务的性能测试有借鉴意义。&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="测试目标">测试目标&lt;/h1>
&lt;h2 id="ub">UB&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>百度在08年开发的RPC框架，在百度产品线广泛使用，已被brpc代替。UB的每个请求独占一个连接(连接池)，在大规模服务中每台机器都需要保持大量的连接，限制了其使用场景，像百度的分布式系统没有用UB。UB只支持nshead+mcpack协议，也没怎么考虑扩展性，所以增加新协议和新功能往往要调整大段代码，在实践中大部分人“知难而退”了。UB缺乏调试和运维接口，服务的运行状态对用户基本是黑盒，只能靠低效地打日志来追踪问题，服务出现问题时常要拉上维护者一起排查，效率很低。UB有多个变种:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>ubrpc: 百度在10年基于UB开发的RPC框架，用.idl文件(类似.proto)描述数据的schema，而不是手动打包。这个RPC有被使用，但不广泛。&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>nova_pbrpc: 百度网盟团队在12年基于UB开发的RPC框架，用protobuf代替mcpack作为序列化方法，协议是nshead + user&amp;rsquo;s protobuf。&lt;/li>
&lt;li>public_pbrpc: 百度在13年初基于UB开发的RPC框架，用protobuf代替mcpack作为序列化方法，但协议与nova_pbrpc不同，大致是nshead + meta protobuf。meta protobuf中有个string字段包含user&amp;rsquo;s protobuf。由于用户数据要序列化两次，这个RPC的性能很差，没有被推广开来。&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>我们以在百度网盟团队广泛使用的nova_pbrpc为UB的代表。测试时其代码为r10500。早期的UB支持CPOOL和XPOOL，分别使用&lt;a href="http://linux.die.net/man/2/select">select&lt;/a>和&lt;a href="http://kircher-schwanninger.de/michael/publications/lf.pdf">leader-follower模型&lt;/a>，后来提供了EPOLL，使用&lt;a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/epoll.7.html">epoll&lt;/a>处理多路连接。鉴于产品线大都是用EPOLL模型，我们的UB配置也使用EPOLL。UB只支持&lt;a href="../client/basics/#connection-type">连接池&lt;/a>，结果用“&lt;strong>ubrpc_mc&lt;/strong>&amp;ldquo;指代（mc代表&amp;quot;multiple
connection&amp;rdquo;）。虽然这个名称不太准确（见上文对ubrpc的介绍），但在本文的语境下，请默认ubrpc = UB。&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="hulu-pbrpc">hulu-pbrpc&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>百度在13年基于saber(kylin变种)和protobuf实现的RPC框架，hulu在多线程实现上有较多问题，已被brpc代替，测试时其代码为&lt;code>pbrpc_2-0-15-27959_PD_BL&lt;/code>。hulu-pbrpc只支持单连接，结果用“&lt;strong>hulu-pbrpc&lt;/strong>&amp;ldquo;指代。&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="brpc">brpc&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>INF在2014年底开发至今的rpc产品，支持百度内所有协议（不限于protobuf），并第一次统一了百度主要分布式系统和业务线的RPC框架。测试时代码为r31906。brpc既支持单连接也支持连接池，前者的结果用&amp;rdquo;&lt;strong>baidu-rpc&lt;/strong>&amp;ldquo;指代，后者用“&lt;strong>baidu-rpc_mc&lt;/strong>&amp;ldquo;指代。&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="sofa-pbrpc">sofa-pbrpc&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>百度大搜团队在13年基于boost::asio和protobuf实现的RPC框架，有多个版本，咨询相关同学后，确认ps/opensource下的和github上的较新，且会定期同步。故测试使用使用ps/opensource下的版本。测试时其代码为&lt;code>sofa-pbrpc_1-0-2_BRANCH&lt;/code>。sofa-pbrpc只支持单连接，结果用“&lt;strong>sofa-pbrpc&lt;/strong>”指代。&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="apache-thrift">apache thrift&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>thrift是由facebook最早在07年开发的序列化方法和rpc框架，包含独特的序列化格式和IDL，支持很多编程语言。开源后改名&lt;a href="https://thrift.apache.org/">apache thrift&lt;/a>，fb自己有一个&lt;a href="https://github.com/facebook/fbthrift">fbthrift分支&lt;/a>，我们使用的是apache thrift。测试时其代码为&lt;code>thrift_0-9-1-400_PD_BL&lt;/code>。thrift的缺点是: 代码看似分层清晰，client和server选择很多，但没有一个足够通用，每个server实现都只能解决很小一块场景，每个client都线程不安全，实际使用很麻烦。由于thrift没有线程安全的client，所以每个线程中都得建立一个client，使用独立的连接。在测试中thrift其实是占了其他实现的便宜: 它的client不需要处理多线程问题。thrift的结果用&amp;rdquo;&lt;strong>thrift_mc&lt;/strong>&amp;ldquo;指代。&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="grpc">gRPC&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>由google开发的rpc框架，使用http/2和protobuf 3.0，测试时其代码为&lt;a href="https://github.com/grpc/grpc/tree/release-0_11">https://github.com/grpc/grpc/tree/release-0_11&lt;/a>。gRPC并不是stubby，定位更像是为了推广http/2和protobuf 3.0，但鉴于很多人对它的表现很感兴趣，我们也（很麻烦地）把它加了进来。gRPC的结果用&amp;rdquo;&lt;strong>grpc&lt;/strong>&amp;ldquo;指代。&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="测试方法">测试方法&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>如序言中解释的那样，性能数字有巨大的调整空间。这里的关键在于，我们对RPC的底线要求是什么，脱离了这个底线，测试中的表现就严重偏离真实环境中的了。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>这个底线我们认为是&lt;strong>RPC必须能处理长尾&lt;/strong>。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>在百度的环境中，这是句大白话，哪个产品线，哪个系统没有长尾呢？作为承载大部分服务的RPC框架自然得处理好长尾，减少长尾对正常请求的影响。但在实现层面，这个问题对设计的影响太大了。如果测试中没有长尾，那么RPC实现就可以假设每个请求都差不多快，这时候最优的方法是用多个线程独立地处理请求。由于没有上下文切换和cache一致性同步，程序的性能会显著高于多个线程协作时的表现。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>比如简单的echo程序，处理一个请求只需要200-300纳秒，单个线程可以达到300-500万的吞吐。但如果多个线程协作，即使在极其流畅的系统中，也要付出3-5微秒的上下文切换代价和1微秒的cache同步代价，这还没有考虑多个线程间的其他互斥逻辑，一般来说单个线程的吞吐很难超过10万，即使24核全部用满，吞吐也只有240万，不及一个线程。这正是以http server为典型的服务选用&lt;a href="../rpc-in-depth/threading-overview/#single-threaded-reactorhttpenwikipediaorgwikireactor_pattern">单线程模型&lt;/a>的原因（多个线程独立运行eventloop）: 大部分http请求的处理时间是可预测的，对下游的访问也不会有任何阻塞代码。这个模型可以最大化cpu利用率，同时提供可接受的延时。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>多线程付出这么大的代价是为了&lt;strong>隔离请求间的影响&lt;/strong>。一个计算复杂或索性阻塞的过程不会影响到其他请求，1%的长尾最终只会影响到1%的性能。而多个独立的线程是保证不了这点的，一个请求进入了一个线程就等于“定了终生”，如果前面的请求慢了一下，那也只能跟着慢了。1%的长尾会影响远超1%的请求，最终表现不佳。换句话说，乍看上去多线程模型“慢”了，但在真实应用中反而会获得更好的综合性能。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>延时能精确地体现出长尾的干扰作用，如果普通请求的延时没有被长尾请求干扰，就说明RPC成功地隔离了请求。而QPS无法体现这点，只要CPU都在忙，即使一个正常请求进入了挤满长尾的队列而被严重延迟，最终的QPS也变化不大。为了测量长尾的干扰作用，我们在涉及到延时的测试中都增加了1%的长尾请求。&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="开始测试">开始测试&lt;/h1>
&lt;h2 id="环境">环境&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>性能测试使用的机器配置为:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>单机1: CPU开超线程24核，E5-2620 @ 2.00GHz；64GB内存；OS linux 2.6.32_1-15-0-0&lt;/li>
&lt;li>多机1（15台+8台）: CPU均未开超线程12核，其中15台的CPU为E5-2420 @ 1.90GHz.，64GB内存，千兆网卡，无法开启多队列。其余8台为E5-2620 2.0GHz，千兆网卡，绑定多队列到前8个核。这些长期测试机器比较杂，跨了多个机房，测试中延时在1ms以上的就是这批机器。&lt;/li>
&lt;li>多机2（30台）: CPU未开超线程12核，E5-2620 v3 @ 2.40GHz.；96GB内存；OS linux 2.6.32_1-17-0-0；万兆网卡，绑定多队列到前8个核。这是临时借用的新机器，配置非常好，都在广州机房，延时非常短，测试中延时在几百微秒的就是这批机器。&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>下面所有的曲线图是使用brpc开发的dashboard程序绘制的，去掉路径后可以看到和所有brpc
server一样的&lt;a href="../builtin-services/buildin_services/">内置服务&lt;/a>。&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="配置">配置&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>如无特殊说明，所有测试中的配置只是数量差异（线程数，请求大小，client个数etc），而不是模型差异。我们确保用户看到的qps和延时是同一个场景的不同维度，而不是无法统一的两个场景。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>所有RPC server都配置了24个工作线程，这些线程一般运行用户的处理逻辑。关于每种RPC的特殊说明:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>UB: 配置了12个reactor线程，使用EPOOL模型。连接池限制数配置为线程个数（24）&lt;/li>
&lt;li>hulu-pbrpc: 额外配置了12个IO线程。这些线程会处理fd读取，请求解析等任务。hulu有个“共享队列“的配置项，默认不打开，作用是把fd静态散列到多个线程中，由于线程间不再争抢，hulu的qps会显著提高，但会明显地被长尾影响（原因见&lt;a href="#%E6%B5%8B%E8%AF%95%E6%96%B9%E6%B3%95">测试方法&lt;/a>）。考虑到大部分使用者并不会去改配置，我们也选择不打开。&lt;/li>
&lt;li>thrift: 额外配置了12个IO线程。这些线程会处理fd读取，请求解析等任务。thrift的client不支持多线程，每个线程得使用独立的client，连接也都是分开的。&lt;/li>
&lt;li>sofa-pbrpc: 按照sofa同学的要求，把io_service_pool_size配置为24，work_thread_num配置为1。大概含义是使用独立的24组线程池，每组1个worker thread。和hulu不打开“共享队列”时类似，这个配置会显著提高sofa-pbrpc的QPS，但同时使它失去了处理长尾的能力。如果你在真实产品中使用，我们不建议这个配置。（而应该用io_service_pool_size=1, work_thread_num=24)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>brpc: 尽管brpc的client运行在bthread中时会获得10%~20%的QPS提升和更低的延时，但测试中的client都运行统一的pthread中。&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>所有的RPC client都以多个线程同步方式发送，这种方法最接近于真实系统中的情况，在考察QPS时也兼顾了延时因素。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>一种流行的方案是client不停地往连接中写入数据看server表现，这个方法的弊端在于: server一下子能读出大量请求，不同RPC的比拼变成了“for循环执行用户代码”的比拼，而不是分发请求的效率。在真实系统中server很少能同时读到超过4个请求。这个方法也完全放弃了延时，client其实是让server陷入了雪崩时才会进入的状态，所有请求都因大量排队而超时了。&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="同机单client单server在不同请求下的qps越高越好">同机单client→单server在不同请求下的QPS（越高越好）&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>本测试运行在&lt;a href="#%E7%8E%AF%E5%A2%83">单机1&lt;/a>上。图中的数值均为用户数据的字节数，实际的请求尺寸还要包括协议头，一般会增加40字节左右。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>（X轴是用户数据的字节数，Y轴是对应的QPS）&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://brpc.apache.org/images/docs/qps_vs_reqsize.png" alt="img">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>以_mc结尾的曲线代表client和server保持多个连接（线程数个），在本测试中会有更好的表现。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>分析&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>brpc: 当请求包小于16KB时，单连接下的吞吐超过了多连接的ubrpc_mc和thrift_mc，随着请求包变大，内核对单个连接的写入速度成为瓶颈。而多连接下的brpc则达到了测试中最高的2.3GB/s。注意: 虽然使用连接池的brpc在发送大包时吞吐更高，但也会耗费更多的CPU（UB和thrift也是这样）。下图中的单连接brpc已经可以提供800多兆的吞吐，足以打满万兆网卡，而使用的CPU可能只有多链接下的1/2(写出过程是&lt;a href="../rpc-in-depth/io#sending-messages">wait-free的&lt;/a>)，真实系统中请优先使用单链接。&lt;/li>
&lt;li>thrift: 初期明显低于brpc，随着包变大超过了单连接的brpc。&lt;/li>
&lt;li>UB:和thrift类似的曲线，但平均要低4-5万QPS，在32K包时超过了单连接的brpc。整个过程中QPS几乎没变过。&lt;/li>
&lt;li>gRPC: 初期几乎与UB平行，但低1万左右，超过8K开始下降。&lt;/li>
&lt;li>hulu-pbrpc和sofa-pbrpc: 512字节前高于UB和gRPC，但之后就急转直下，相继垫底。这个趋势是写不够并发的迹象。&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="同机单client单server在不同线程数下的qps越高越好">同机单client→单server在不同线程数下的QPS（越高越好）&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>本测试运行在&lt;a href="#%E7%8E%AF%E5%A2%83">单机1&lt;/a>上。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>（X轴是线程数，Y轴是对应的QPS）&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://brpc.apache.org/images/docs/qps_vs_threadnum.png" alt="img">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>分析&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>brpc: 随着发送线程增加，QPS在快速增加，有很好的多线程扩展性。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>UB和thrift: 8个线程下高于brpc，但超过8个线程后被brpc迅速超过，thrift继续“平移”，UB出现了明显下降。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>gRPC，hulu-pbrpc，sofa-pbrpc: 几乎重合，256个线程时相比1个线程时只有1倍的提升，多线程扩展性不佳。&lt;/p>

&lt;li>thrift: 平均延时显著高于brpc和UB。&lt;/li>
&lt;li>sofa-pbrpc: 17%的普通请求被长尾严重干扰，其中2%的请求延时极长。&lt;/li>
&lt;li>hulu-pbrpc: 基本消失在视野中，已无法正常工作。&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h1 id="结论">结论&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>brpc: 在吞吐，平均延时，长尾处理上都表现优秀。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>UB: 平均延时和长尾处理的表现都不错，吞吐的扩展性较差，提高线程数和client数几乎不能提升吞吐。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>thrift: 单机的平均延时和吞吐尚可，多机的平均延时明显高于brpc和UB。吞吐的扩展性较差，提高线程数和client数几乎不能提升吞吐。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>sofa-pbrpc: 处理小包的吞吐尚可，大包的吞吐显著低于其他RPC，延时受长尾影响很大。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>hulu-pbrpc: 单机表现和sofa-pbrpc类似，但多机的延时表现极差。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>gRPC: 几乎在所有参与的测试中垫底，可能它的定位是给google cloud platform的用户提供一个多语言，对网络友好的实现，性能还不是要务。&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Docs: bRPC 1.5.0</title><link>https://brpc.apache.org/docs/blogs/releases/1.5.0/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 May 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://brpc.apache.org/docs/blogs/releases/1.5.0/</guid><description>

&lt;h1 id="brpc-apache-release-guide-step-by-step">brpc apache release guide step by step&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Overview: divided into the following steps&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Preparation: including generating the key required for signature, creating github release branch and tag, modifying the version file, etc&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Publish software package: including making source tarball, signing, uploading to the designated location and verifying&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Vote: including voting in mail group &lt;code>dev@brpc.apache.org&lt;/code> and &lt;code>general@incubator.apache.org&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Release announcement: including updating brpc website, sending announcement emails, posting WeChat official account announcements, merging the release branche into the master branch&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h2 id="prepare-key">Prepare key&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="1-install-gpg">1. Install GPG&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Download the installation package from &lt;a href="https://www.gnupg.org/download/index.html">GnuPG official website&lt;/a>. The commands of GnuPG version 1.x and version 2.x are slightly different. The following instructions take the &lt;code>GnuPG-2.3.1&lt;/code> version (OSX) as an example.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After the installation is complete, execute the following command to check the version number.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#f8f8f8;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>gpg --version
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;h3 id="2-create-key">2. Create key&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>After the installation is complete, execute the following command to create a key.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#f8f8f8;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>gpg --full-gen-key
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Complete the key creation according to the prompts. Note that the mailbox should use the Apache email address, and the &lt;code>Real Name&lt;/code> can use Apache ID or GitHub ID:&lt;/p>

RSA keys may be between 1024 and 4096 bits long.
What keysize do you want? (3072) 4096
Requested keysize is 4096 bits
Please specify how long the key should be valid.
0 = key does not expire
&amp;lt;n&amp;gt; = key expires in n days
&amp;lt;n&amp;gt;w = key expires in n weeks
&amp;lt;n&amp;gt;m = key expires in n months
&amp;lt;n&amp;gt;y = key expires in n years
Key is valid for? (0) 0
Key does not expire at all
Is this correct? (y/N) y
GnuPG needs to construct a user ID to identify your key.
Real name: LorinLee
Email address: lorinlee@apache.org
Comment: lorinlee&amp;#39;s key
You selected this USER-ID:
&amp;#34;LorinLee (lorinlee&amp;#39;s key) &amp;lt;lorinlee@apache.org&amp;gt;&amp;#34;
Change (N)ame, (C)omment, (E)mail or (O)kay/(Q)uit? O
You need a Passphrase to protect your secret key. # Input password
We need to generate a lot of random bytes. It is a good idea to perform
some other action (type on the keyboard, move the mouse, utilize the
disks) during the prime generation; this gives the random number
generator a better chance to gain enough entropy.

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Severity&lt;/strong>: Important&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Affected Versions&lt;/strong>: Apache bRPC 0.9.0 before 1.5.0&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Description&lt;/strong>:
Security vulnerability in Apache bRPC &amp;lt;1.5.0 on all platforms allows attackers to execute arbitrary code via ServerOptions::pid_file.
An attacker that can influence the ServerOptions pid_file parameter with which the bRPC server is started can execute arbitrary code with the permissions of the bRPC process.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Solution&lt;/strong>:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>upgrade to bRPC &amp;gt;= 1.5.0, download link: &lt;a href="https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/brpc/1.5.0/">https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/brpc/1.5.0/&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you are using an old version of bRPC and hard to upgrade, you can apply this patch: &lt;a href="https://github.com/apache/brpc/pull/2218">https://github.com/apache/brpc/pull/2218&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Required Configurations&lt;/strong>:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>set brpc::ServerOptions::pid_file from user input&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Work Arounds&lt;/strong>:&lt;/p>
