    <h1 class="section-head">Why bRPC?</h1>
    <p>
    bRPC is an Industrial-grade RPC framework using C++ Language, which is often used in high performance system such as Search, Storage, Machine learning, Advertisement, Recommendation etc.
    </p>
    <h3 class="section-head">You can use it to:</h3>
    <div class="father" style="display: flex; justify-content: center; margin: 0 20px">
      <div class="child">
        <li style="text-align:left">Build a server that can talk in multiple protocols (on same port), or access all sorts of services.</li>
        <ol style="text-align:left">
          <li>
            restful http/https, h2/gRPC. using http/h2 in bRPC is much more friendly than libcurl. Access protobuf-based protocols with HTTP/h2+json, probably from another language.
          </li>
          <li>redis and memcached, thread-safe, more friendly and performant than the official clients.</li>
          <li>rtmp/flv/hls, for building streaming services.</li>
          <li>hadoop_rpc (may be opensourced)</li>
          <li>rdma support (will be opensourced)</li>
          <li>thrift support, thread-safe, more friendly and performant than the official clients.</li>
          <li>all sorts of protocols used in Baidu: baidu_std, streaming_rpc, hulu_pbrpc, sofa_pbrpc, nova_pbrpc, public_pbrpc, ubrpc and nshead-based ones.</li>
          <li>Build HA distributed services using an industrial-grade implementation of RAFT consensus algorithm which is opensourced at braft</li>
        </ol> 
        <li style="text-align:left">Servers can handle requests synchronously or asynchronously.</li>
        <li style="text-align:left">Clients can access servers synchronously, asynchronously, semi-synchronously, or use combo channels to simplify sharded or parallel accesses declaratively.</li>
        <li style="text-align:left">Debug services via http, and run cpu, heap and contention profilers.</li>
        <li style="text-align:left">Get better latency and throughput.</li>
        <li style="text-align:left">Extend bRPC with the protocols used in your organization quickly, or customize components, including naming services (dns, zk, etcd), load balancers (rr, random, consistent hashing)</li>

    <h4>
      bRPC is an <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/">Apache</a> incubation project.
    </h4>
    <h6>
      Apache Annotator is an effort undergoing incubation at The <a href="https://apache.org/">Apache Software Foundation (ASF)</a> 
      sponsored by the Apache Incubator PMC. Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects until a further review indicates 
      that the infrastructure, communications, and decision making process have stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful 
      ASF projects. While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or stability of the code, it does 
      indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.
