  How to be a bRPC Committer.
---
Participants in the Apache community have the following roles: **Contributor**, **Committer**, and **PMC(Project Member Committee) member**.

When an individual contribution is accepted by the project, he/she will automatically become a Contributor.
Committer and PMC members are invited by the PMC after a consensus vote.

Here we will only discuss some guidelines for the bRPC community to invite Committer and PMC member in order to be able to effectively estimate developer participation in the community.

## The Apache Way:
Before anyone can become a Committer or PMC member of an Apache project, they should first understand "[What's TheApacheWay](https://apache.org/theapacheway/index.html)".

## Guidance for Committer:
Have significant feature contributions (not limited to code), or long-term participation in community building (bug fixing, code review, documentation translation and proofreading, community outreach, etc.)
Participate in community discussions in public domain and have a positive impact.
## Guidance for PMC member:
Be able to actively participate in community maintenance work, such as answering emails, organizing wiki, release management, code review, etc.
Recognize the Apache community philosophy and be able to actively promote the community development.
## Peer Review:
The above requirements are highly subjective and cannot be measured quantitatively. Therefore, the PMC needs to form a regular review mechanism to discuss and invite people who meet the requirements.

Conduct a review every 1-2 months to nominate and discuss suitable candidates
