Most machines on internet communicate with each other via TCP/IP. However, TCP/IP only guarantees reliable data transmissions. We need to abstract more to build services:\nWhat is the format of data transmission? Different machines and networks may have different byte-orders, directly sending in-memory data is not suitable. Fields in the data are added, modified or removed gradually, how do newer services talk with older services? Can TCP connection be reused for multiple requests to reduce overhead? Can multiple requests be sent through one TCP connection simultaneously? How to talk with a cluster with many machines? What should I do when the connection is broken? What if the server does not respond? \u0026hellip; RPC addresses the above issues by abstracting network communications as \u0026ldquo;clients accessing functions on servers\u0026rdquo;: client sends a request to server, wait until server receives -\u0026gt; processes -\u0026gt; responds to the request, then do actions according to the result. Let\u0026rsquo;s see how the issues are solved.\nRPC needs serialization which is done by protobuf pretty well. Users fill requests in format of protobuf::Message, do RPC, and fetch results from responses in protobuf::Message. protobuf has good forward and backward compatibility for users to change fields and build services incrementally. For http services, json is used for serialization extensively. Establishment and re-using of connections is transparent to users, but users can make choices like different connection types: short, pooled, single. Machines are discovered by a Naming Service, which can be implemented by DNS, ZooKeeper or etcd. Inside Baidu, we use BNS (Baidu Naming Service). brpc provides \u0026ldquo;list://\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;file://\u0026rdquo; as well. Users specify load balancing algorithms to choose one machine for each request from all machines, including: round-robin, randomized, consistent-hashing(murmurhash3 or md5) and locality-aware. RPC retries when the connection is broken. When server does not respond within the given time, client fails with a timeout error. Where can I use RPC? Almost all network communications.\nRPC can\u0026rsquo;t do everything surely, otherwise we don\u0026rsquo;t need the layer of TCP/IP. But in most network communications, RPC meets requirements and isolates the underlying details.\nCommon doubts on RPC:\nMy data is binary and large, using protobuf will be slow. First, this is possibly a wrong feeling and you will have to test it and prove it with profilers. Second, many protocols support carrying binary data along with protobuf requests and bypass the serialization. I\u0026rsquo;m sending streaming data which can\u0026rsquo;t be processed by RPC. Actually many protocols in RPC can handle streaming data, including ProgressiveReader in http, streams in h2, streaming rpc, and RTMP which is a specialized streaming protocol. I don\u0026rsquo;t need replies. With some inductions, we know that in your scenario requests can be dropped at any stage because the client is always unaware of the situation. Are you really sure this is acceptable? Even if you don\u0026rsquo;t need the reply, we recommend sending back small-sized replies, which are unlikely to be performance bottlenecks and will probably provide valuable clues when debugging complex bugs. What is ? An industrial-grade RPC framework used throughout Baidu, with 1,000,000+ instances(not counting clients) and thousands kinds of services, called \u0026ldquo;baidu-rpc\u0026rdquo; inside Baidu. Only C++ implementation is opensourced right now.\nYou can use it to:\nBuild a server that can talk in multiple protocols (on same port), or access all sorts of services restful http/https, h2/gRPC. using http/h2 in brpc is much more friendly than libcurl. Access protobuf-based protocols with HTTP/h2+json, probably from another language. redis and memcached, thread-safe, more friendly and performant than the official clients rtmp/flv/hls, for building streaming services. hadoop_rpc (may be opensourced) rdma support (will be opensourced) thrift support, thread-safe, more friendly and performant than the official clients. all sorts of protocols used in Baidu: baidu_std, streaming_rpc, hulu_pbrpc, sofa_pbrpc, nova_pbrpc, public_pbrpc, ubrpc, and nshead-based ones. Build HA distributed services using an industrial-grade implementation of RAFT consensus algorithm which is opensourced at braft Servers can handle requests synchronously or asynchronously. Clients can access servers synchronously, asynchronously, semi-synchronously, or use combo channels to simplify sharded or parallel accesses declaratively. Debug services via http, and run cpu, heap and contention profilers. Get better latency and throughput. Extend brpc with the protocols used in your organization quickly, or customize components, including naming services (dns, zk, etcd), load balancers (rr, random, consistent hashing) Advantages of bRPC More friendly API Only 3 (major) user headers: Server, Channel, Controller, corresponding to server-side, client-side and parameter-set respectively. You don\u0026rsquo;t have to worry about \u0026ldquo;How to initialize XXXManager\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;How to layer all these components together\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s the relationship between XXXController and XXXContext\u0026rdquo;. All you need to do is simple:\nBuild service? include brpc/server.h and follow the comments or examples.\nAccess service? include brpc/channel.h and follow the comments or examples.\nTweak parameters? Checkout brpc/controller.h. Note that the class is shared by server and channel. Methods are separated into 3 parts: client-side, server-side and both-side.\nWe tried to make simple things simple. Take naming service as an example. In older RPC implementations you may need to copy a pile of obscure code to make it work, however, in brpc accessing BNS is expressed as Init(\u0026quot;bns://node-name\u0026quot;, ...), DNS is Init(\u0026quot;http://domain-name\u0026quot;, ...) and local machine list is Init(\u0026quot;file:///home/work/server.list\u0026quot;, ...). Without any explanation, you know what it means.\nMake services more reliable brpc is extensively used in Baidu:\nmap-reduce service \u0026amp; table storages high-performance computing \u0026amp; model training all sorts of indexing \u0026amp; ranking servers …. It\u0026rsquo;s been proven.\nbrpc pays special attentions to development and maintenance efficency, you can view internal status of servers in web browser or with curl, analyze cpu hotspots, heap allocations and lock contentions of online services, measure stats by bvar which is viewable in /vars.\nBetter latency and throughput Although almost all RPC implementations claim that they\u0026rsquo;re \u0026ldquo;high-performant\u0026rdquo;, the numbers are probably just numbers. Being really high-performant in different scenarios is difficult. To unify communication infra inside Baidu, brpc goes much deeper at performance than other implementations.\nReading and parsing requests from different clients is fully parallelized and users don\u0026rsquo;t need to distinguish between \u0026ldquo;IO-threads\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Processing-threads\u0026rdquo;. Other implementations probably have \u0026ldquo;IO-threads\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Processing-threads\u0026rdquo; and hash file descriptors(fd) into IO-threads. When a IO-thread handles one of its fds, other fds in the thread can\u0026rsquo;t be handled. If a message is large, other fds are significantly delayed. Although different IO-threads run in parallel, you won\u0026rsquo;t have many IO-threads since they don\u0026rsquo;t have too much to do generally except reading/parsing from fds. If you have 10 IO-threads, one fd may affect 10% of all fds, which is unacceptable to industrial online services (requiring 99.99% availability). The problem will be worse when fds are distributed unevenly accross IO-threads (unfortunately common), or the service is multi-tenancy (common in cloud services). In brpc, reading from different fds is parallelized and even processing different messages from one fd is parallelized as well. Parsing a large message does not block other messages from the same fd, not to mention other fds. More details can be found here. Writing into one fd and multiple fds is highly concurrent. When multiple threads write into the same fd (common for multiplexed connections), the first thread directly writes in-place and other threads submit their write requests in wait-free manner. One fd can be written into 5,000,000 16-byte messages per second by a couple of highly-contended threads. More details can be found here. Minimal locks. High-QPS services can utilize all CPU power on the machine. For example, creating bthreads for processing requests, setting up timeout, finding RPC contexts according to response, recording performance counters are all highly concurrent. Users see very few contentions (via contention profiler) caused by RPC framework even if the service runs at 500,000+ QPS. Server adjusts thread number according to load. Traditional implementations set number of threads according to latency to avoid limiting the throughput. brpc creates a new bthread for each request and ends the bthread when the request is done, which automatically adjusts thread number according to load. Check benchmark for a comparison between brpc and other implementations.\n","excerpt":"What is RPC? Most machines on internet communicate with each other via TCP/IP.

Even different minor versions may differ. When you program behave unexpectedly, remove tcmalloc or try another version.\nCode compiled with gcc 4.8.2 and linked to a tcmalloc compiled with earlier GCC may crash or deadlock before main(), E.g:\nWhen you meet the issue, compile tcmalloc with the same GCC.\nAnother common issue with tcmalloc is that it does not return memory to system as early as ptmalloc. So when there\u0026rsquo;s an invalid memory access, the program may not crash directly, instead it crashes at a unrelated place, or even not crash. When you program has weird memory issues, try removing tcmalloc.\nIf you want to use cpu profiler or heap profiler, do link libtcmalloc_and_profiler.a. These two profilers are based on tcmalloc. contention profiler does not require tcmalloc.\nWhen you remove tcmalloc, not only remove the linkage with tcmalloc but also the macro -DBRPC_ENABLE_CPU_PROFILER.\nglog: 3.3+ brpc implements a default logging utility which conflicts with glog. To replace this with glog, add \u0026ndash;with-glog to config_brpc.sh or add -DWITH_GLOG=ON to cmake.\nvalgrind: 3.8+ brpc detects valgrind automatically (and registers stacks of bthread). Older valgrind(say 3.2) is not supported.\nthrift: 0.9.3-0.11.0 no known issues.\nTrack instances We provide a program to help you to track and monitor all brpc instances. Just run trackme_server somewhere and launch need-to-be-tracked instances with -trackme_server=SERVER. The trackme_server will receive pings from instances periodically and print logs when it does. You can aggregate instance addresses from the log and call builtin services of the instances for further information.\n","excerpt":"BUILD brpc prefers static linkages of deps, so that they

一次跳转意味着至少3-20微秒的延时，由于每个核心的L1 cache独立（我们的cpu L2 cache也是独立的），随之而来是大量的cache miss，一些变量的读取、写入延时会从纳秒级上升几百倍至微秒级: 等待cpu把对应的cacheline同步过来。有时这带来了一个出乎意料的结果，当每次的处理都很简短时，一个多线程程序未必比一个单线程程序更快。因为前者可能在每次付出了大的切换代价后只做了一点点“正事”，而后者在不停地做“正事”。不过单线程也是有代价的，它工作良好的前提是“正事”都很快，否则一旦某次变慢就使后续的所有“正事”都被延迟了。在一些处理时间普遍较短的程序中，使用（多个不相交的）单线程能最大程度地”做正事“，由于每个请求的处理时间确定，延时表现也很稳定，各种http server正是这样。但我们的检索服务要做的事情可就复杂多了，有大量的后端服务需要访问，广泛存在的长尾请求使每次处理的时间无法确定，排序策略也越来越复杂。如果还是使用（多个不相交的）单线程的话，一次难以预计的性能抖动，或是一个大请求可能导致后续一堆请求被延迟。\n为了避免请求之间相互影响，请求级的线程跳转是brpc必须付出的代价，我们能做的是使线程跳转最优化。不过，对服务的性能测试还不能很好地体现这点。测试中的处理往往极为简单，使得线程切换的影响空前巨大，通过控制多线程和单线程处理的比例，我们可以把一个测试服务的qps从100万到500万操纵自如（同机），这损伤了性能测试结果的可信度。要知道，真实的服务并不是在累加一个数字，或者echo一个字符串，一个qps几百万的echo程序没有指导意义。鉴于此，在发起性能测试一年后（15年底），在brpc又经历了1200多次改动后，我们需要review所有的测试，加强其中的线程因素，以获得对真实场景有明确意义的结果。具体来说:\n请求不应等长，要有长尾。这能考察RPC能否让请求并发，否则一个慢请求会影响大量后续请求。 要有多级server的场景。server内用client访问下游server，这能考察server和client的综合表现。 要有一个client访问多个server的场景。这能考察负载均衡是否足够并发，真实场景中很少一个client只访问一个server。 我们希望这套测试场景对其他服务的性能测试有借鉴意义。\n测试目标 UB 百度在08年开发的RPC框架，在百度产品线广泛使用，已被brpc代替。UB的每个请求独占一个连接(连接池)，在大规模服务中每台机器都需要保持大量的连接，限制了其使用场景，像百度的分布式系统没有用UB。UB只支持nshead+mcpack协议，也没怎么考虑扩展性，所以增加新协议和新功能往往要调整大段代码，在实践中大部分人“知难而退”了。UB缺乏调试和运维接口，服务的运行状态对用户基本是黑盒，只能靠低效地打日志来追踪问题，服务出现问题时常要拉上维护者一起排查，效率很低。UB有多个变种:\nubrpc: 百度在10年基于UB开发的RPC框架，用.idl文件(类似.proto)描述数据的schema，而不是手动打包。这个RPC有被使用，但不广泛。 nova_pbrpc: 百度网盟团队在12年基于UB开发的RPC框架，用protobuf代替mcpack作为序列化方法，协议是nshead + user\u0026rsquo;s protobuf。 public_pbrpc: 百度在13年初基于UB开发的RPC框架，用protobuf代替mcpack作为序列化方法，但协议与nova_pbrpc不同，大致是nshead + meta protobuf。meta protobuf中有个string字段包含user\u0026rsquo;s protobuf。由于用户数据要序列化两次，这个RPC的性能很差，没有被推广开来。 我们以在百度网盟团队广泛使用的nova_pbrpc为UB的代表。测试时其代码为r10500。早期的UB支持CPOOL和XPOOL，分别使用select和leader-follower模型，后来提供了EPOLL，使用epoll处理多路连接。鉴于产品线大都是用EPOLL模型，我们的UB配置也使用EPOLL。UB只支持连接池，结果用“ubrpc_mc\u0026ldquo;指代（mc代表\u0026quot;multiple connection\u0026rdquo;）。虽然这个名称不太准确（见上文对ubrpc的介绍），但在本文的语境下，请默认ubrpc = UB。\nhulu-pbrpc 百度在13年基于saber(kylin变种)和protobuf实现的RPC框架，hulu在多线程实现上有较多问题，已被brpc代替，测试时其代码为pbrpc_2-0-15-27959_PD_BL。hulu-pbrpc只支持单连接，结果用“hulu-pbrpc\u0026ldquo;指代。\nbrpc INF在2014年底开发至今的rpc产品，支持百度内所有协议（不限于protobuf），并第一次统一了百度主要分布式系统和业务线的RPC框架。测试时代码为r31906。brpc既支持单连接也支持连接池，前者的结果用\u0026rdquo;baidu-rpc\u0026ldquo;指代，后者用“baidu-rpc_mc\u0026ldquo;指代。\nsofa-pbrpc 百度大搜团队在13年基于boost::asio和protobuf实现的RPC框架，有多个版本，咨询相关同学后，确认ps/opensource下的和github上的较新，且会定期同步。故测试使用使用ps/opensource下的版本。测试时其代码为sofa-pbrpc_1-0-2_BRANCH。sofa-pbrpc只支持单连接，结果用“sofa-pbrpc”指代。\napache thrift thrift是由facebook最早在07年开发的序列化方法和rpc框架，包含独特的序列化格式和IDL，支持很多编程语言。开源后改名apache thrift，fb自己有一个fbthrift分支，我们使用的是apache thrift。测试时其代码为thrift_0-9-1-400_PD_BL。thrift的缺点是: 代码看似分层清晰，client和server选择很多，但没有一个足够通用，每个server实现都只能解决很小一块场景，每个client都线程不安全，实际使用很麻烦。由于thrift没有线程安全的client，所以每个线程中都得建立一个client，使用独立的连接。在测试中thrift其实是占了其他实现的便宜: 它的client不需要处理多线程问题。thrift的结果用\u0026rdquo;thrift_mc\u0026ldquo;指代。\ngRPC 由google开发的rpc框架，使用http/2和protobuf 3.0，测试时其代码为https://github.com/grpc/grpc/tree/release-0_11。gRPC并不是stubby，定位更像是为了推广http/2和protobuf 3.0，但鉴于很多人对它的表现很感兴趣，我们也（很麻烦地）把它加了进来。gRPC的结果用\u0026rdquo;grpc\u0026ldquo;指代。\n测试方法 如序言中解释的那样，性能数字有巨大的调整空间。这里的关键在于，我们对RPC的底线要求是什么，脱离了这个底线，测试中的表现就严重偏离真实环境中的了。\n这个底线我们认为是RPC必须能处理长尾。\n在百度的环境中，这是句大白话，哪个产品线，哪个系统没有长尾呢？作为承载大部分服务的RPC框架自然得处理好长尾，减少长尾对正常请求的影响。但在实现层面，这个问题对设计的影响太大了。如果测试中没有长尾，那么RPC实现就可以假设每个请求都差不多快，这时候最优的方法是用多个线程独立地处理请求。由于没有上下文切换和cache一致性同步，程序的性能会显著高于多个线程协作时的表现。\n比如简单的echo程序，处理一个请求只需要200-300纳秒，单个线程可以达到300-500万的吞吐。但如果多个线程协作，即使在极其流畅的系统中，也要付出3-5微秒的上下文切换代价和1微秒的cache同步代价，这还没有考虑多个线程间的其他互斥逻辑，一般来说单个线程的吞吐很难超过10万，即使24核全部用满，吞吐也只有240万，不及一个线程。这正是以http server为典型的服务选用单线程模型的原因（多个线程独立运行eventloop）: 大部分http请求的处理时间是可预测的，对下游的访问也不会有任何阻塞代码。这个模型可以最大化cpu利用率，同时提供可接受的延时。\n多线程付出这么大的代价是为了隔离请求间的影响。一个计算复杂或索性阻塞的过程不会影响到其他请求，1%的长尾最终只会影响到1%的性能。而多个独立的线程是保证不了这点的，一个请求进入了一个线程就等于“定了终生”，如果前面的请求慢了一下，那也只能跟着慢了。1%的长尾会影响远超1%的请求，最终表现不佳。换句话说，乍看上去多线程模型“慢”了，但在真实应用中反而会获得更好的综合性能。\n延时能精确地体现出长尾的干扰作用，如果普通请求的延时没有被长尾请求干扰，就说明RPC成功地隔离了请求。而QPS无法体现这点，只要CPU都在忙，即使一个正常请求进入了挤满长尾的队列而被严重延迟，最终的QPS也变化不大。为了测量长尾的干扰作用，我们在涉及到延时的测试中都增加了1%的长尾请求。\n开始测试 环境 性能测试使用的机器配置为:\n单机1: CPU开超线程24核，E5-2620 @ 2.00GHz；64GB内存；OS linux 2.6.32_1-15-0-0 多机1（15台+8台）: CPU均未开超线程12核，其中15台的CPU为E5-2420 @ 1.90GHz.，64GB内存，千兆网卡，无法开启多队列。其余8台为E5-2620 2.0GHz，千兆网卡，绑定多队列到前8个核。这些长期测试机器比较杂，跨了多个机房，测试中延时在1ms以上的就是这批机器。 多机2（30台）: CPU未开超线程12核，E5-2620 v3 @ 2.40GHz.；96GB内存；OS linux 2.6.32_1-17-0-0；万兆网卡，绑定多队列到前8个核。这是临时借用的新机器，配置非常好，都在广州机房，延时非常短，测试中延时在几百微秒的就是这批机器。 下面所有的曲线图是使用brpc开发的dashboard程序绘制的，去掉路径后可以看到和所有brpc server一样的内置服务。\n配置 如无特殊说明，所有测试中的配置只是数量差异（线程数，请求大小，client个数etc），而不是模型差异。我们确保用户看到的qps和延时是同一个场景的不同维度，而不是无法统一的两个场景。\n所有RPC server都配置了24个工作线程，这些线程一般运行用户的处理逻辑。关于每种RPC的特殊说明:\nUB: 配置了12个reactor线程，使用EPOOL模型。连接池限制数配置为线程个数（24） hulu-pbrpc: 额外配置了12个IO线程。这些线程会处理fd读取，请求解析等任务。hulu有个“共享队列“的配置项，默认不打开，作用是把fd静态散列到多个线程中，由于线程间不再争抢，hulu的qps会显著提高，但会明显地被长尾影响（原因见测试方法）。考虑到大部分使用者并不会去改配置，我们也选择不打开。 thrift: 额外配置了12个IO线程。这些线程会处理fd读取，请求解析等任务。thrift的client不支持多线程，每个线程得使用独立的client，连接也都是分开的。 sofa-pbrpc: 按照sofa同学的要求，把io_service_pool_size配置为24，work_thread_num配置为1。大概含义是使用独立的24组线程池，每组1个worker thread。和hulu不打开“共享队列”时类似，这个配置会显著提高sofa-pbrpc的QPS，但同时使它失去了处理长尾的能力。如果你在真实产品中使用，我们不建议这个配置。（而应该用io_service_pool_size=1, work_thread_num=24) brpc: 尽管brpc的client运行在bthread中时会获得10%~20%的QPS提升和更低的延时，但测试中的client都运行统一的pthread中。 所有的RPC client都以多个线程同步方式发送，这种方法最接近于真实系统中的情况，在考察QPS时也兼顾了延时因素。\n一种流行的方案是client不停地往连接中写入数据看server表现，这个方法的弊端在于: server一下子能读出大量请求，不同RPC的比拼变成了“for循环执行用户代码”的比拼，而不是分发请求的效率。在真实系统中server很少能同时读到超过4个请求。这个方法也完全放弃了延时，client其实是让server陷入了雪崩时才会进入的状态，所有请求都因大量排队而超时了。\n同机单client→单server在不同请求下的QPS（越高越好） 本测试运行在单机1上。图中的数值均为用户数据的字节数，实际的请求尺寸还要包括协议头，一般会增加40字节左右。\n（X轴是用户数据的字节数，Y轴是对应的QPS）\n以_mc结尾的曲线代表client和server保持多个连接（线程数个），在本测试中会有更好的表现。\n分析\nbrpc: 当请求包小于16KB时，单连接下的吞吐超过了多连接的ubrpc_mc和thrift_mc，随着请求包变大，内核对单个连接的写入速度成为瓶颈。而多连接下的brpc则达到了测试中最高的2.3GB/s。注意: 虽然使用连接池的brpc在发送大包时吞吐更高，但也会耗费更多的CPU（UB和thrift也是这样）。下图中的单连接brpc已经可以提供800多兆的吞吐，足以打满万兆网卡，而使用的CPU可能只有多链接下的1/2(写出过程是wait-free的)，真实系统中请优先使用单链接。 thrift: 初期明显低于brpc，随着包变大超过了单连接的brpc。 UB:和thrift类似的曲线，但平均要低4-5万QPS，在32K包时超过了单连接的brpc。整个过程中QPS几乎没变过。 gRPC: 初期几乎与UB平行，但低1万左右，超过8K开始下降。 hulu-pbrpc和sofa-pbrpc: 512字节前高于UB和gRPC，但之后就急转直下，相继垫底。这个趋势是写不够并发的迹象。 同机单client→单server在不同线程数下的QPS（越高越好） 本测试运行在单机1上。\n（X轴是线程数，Y轴是对应的QPS）\n分析\nbrpc: 随着发送线程增加，QPS在快速增加，有很好的多线程扩展性。\nUB和thrift: 8个线程下高于brpc，但超过8个线程后被brpc迅速超过，thrift继续“平移”，UB出现了明显下降。\ngRPC，hulu-pbrpc，sofa-pbrpc: 几乎重合，256个线程时相比1个线程时只有1倍的提升，多线程扩展性不佳。\n同机单client→单server在固定QPS下的延时CDF（越左越好，越直越好） 本测试运行在单机1上。考虑到不同RPC的处理能力，我们选择了一个较低、在不少系统中会达到的的QPS: 1万。\n本测试中有1%的长尾请求耗时5毫秒，长尾请求的延时不计入结果，因为我们考察的是普通请求是否被及时处理了。\n（X轴是延时（微秒），Y轴是小于X轴延时的请求比例）\n分析\nbrpc: 平均延时短，几乎没有被长尾影响。 UB和thrift: 平均延时比brpc高1毫秒，受长尾影响不大。 hulu-pbrpc: 走向和UB和thrift类似，但平均延时进一步增加了1毫秒。 gRPC : 初期不错，到长尾区域后表现糟糕，直接有一部分请求超时了。（反复测试都是这样，像是有bug） sofa-pbrpc: 30%的普通请求（上图未显示）被长尾严重干扰。 跨机多client→单server的QPS（越高越好） 本测试运行在多机1上。\n（X轴是client数，Y轴是对应的QPS）\n分析\nbrpc: 随着cilent增加，server的QPS在快速增加，有不错的client扩展性。 sofa-pbrpc: 随着client增加，server的QPS也在快速增加，但幅度不如brpc，client扩展性也不错。从16个client到32个client时的提升较小。 hulu-pbrpc: 随着client增加，server的QPS在增加，但幅度进一步小于sofa-pbrpc。 UB: 增加client几乎不能增加server的QPS。 thrift: 平均QPS低于UB，增加client几乎不能增加server的QPS。 gRPC: 垫底、增加client几乎不能增加server的QPS。 跨机多client→单server在固定QPS下的延时CDF（越左越好，越直越好） 本测试运行在多机1上。负载均衡算法为round-robin或RPC默认提供的。由于有32个client且一些RPC的单client能力不佳，我们为每个client仅设定了2500QPS，这是一个真实业务系统能达到的数字。\n本测试中有1%的长尾请求耗时15毫秒，长尾请求的延时不计入结果，因为我们考察的是普通请求是否被及时处理了。\n（X轴是延时（微秒），Y轴是小于X轴延时的请求比例）\n分析\nbrpc: 平均延时短，几乎没有被长尾影响。 UB和thrift: 平均延时短，受长尾影响小，平均延时高于brpc sofa-pbrpc: 14%的普通请求被长尾严重干扰。 hulu-pbrpc: 15%的普通请求被长尾严重干扰。 gRPC: 已经完全失控，非常糟糕。 跨机多client→多server在固定QPS下的延时CDF（越左越好，越直越好） 本测试运行在多机2上。20台每台运行4个client，多线程同步访问10台server。负载均衡算法为round-robin或RPC默认提供的。由于gRPC访问多server较麻烦且有很大概率仍表现不佳，这个测试不包含gRPC。\n本测试中有1%的长尾请求耗时10毫秒，长尾请求的延时不计入结果，因为我们考察的是普通请求是否被及时处理了。\n（X轴是延时（微秒），Y轴是小于X轴延时的请求比例）\n分析\nbrpc和UB: 平均延时短，几乎没有被长尾影响。 thrift: 平均延时显著高于brpc和UB。 sofa-pbrpc: 2.5%的普通请求被长尾严重干扰。 hulu-pbrpc: 22%的普通请求被长尾严重干扰。 跨机多client→多server→多server在固定QPS下的延时CDF（越左越好，越直越好） 本测试运行在多机2上。14台每台运行4个client，多线程同步访问8台server，这些server还会同步访问另外8台server。负载均衡算法为round-robin或RPC默认提供的。由于gRPC访问多server较麻烦且有很大概率仍表现不佳，这个测试不包含gRPC。\n本测试中有1%的长尾请求耗时10毫秒，长尾请求的延时不计入结果，因为我们考察的是普通请求是否被及时处理了。\n（X轴是延时（微秒），Y轴是小于X轴延时的请求比例）\n分析\nbrpc: 平均延时短，几乎没有被长尾影响。 UB: 平均延时短，长尾区域略差于brpc。 thrift: 平均延时显著高于brpc和UB。 sofa-pbrpc: 17%的普通请求被长尾严重干扰，其中2%的请求延时极长。 hulu-pbrpc: 基本消失在视野中，已无法正常工作。 结论 brpc: 在吞吐，平均延时，长尾处理上都表现优秀。\nUB: 平均延时和长尾处理的表现都不错，吞吐的扩展性较差，提高线程数和client数几乎不能提升吞吐。\nthrift: 单机的平均延时和吞吐尚可，多机的平均延时明显高于brpc和UB。吞吐的扩展性较差，提高线程数和client数几乎不能提升吞吐。\nsofa-pbrpc: 处理小包的吞吐尚可，大包的吞吐显著低于其他RPC，延时受长尾影响很大。\nhulu-pbrpc: 单机表现和sofa-pbrpc类似，但多机的延时表现极差。\ngRPC: 几乎在所有参与的测试中垫底，可能它的定位是给google cloud platform的用户提供一个多语言，对网络友好的实现，性能还不是要务。\n","excerpt":"序言 在多核的前提下，性能和线程是紧密联系在一起的。线程间的跳转对高频IO操作的性能有决定性作用:

Channel.CallMethod() is thread-safe and a Channel can be used by multiple threads simultaneously. Channel can be put on stack. Channel can be destructed just after sending asynchronous request. No class named brpc::Client. Channel Client-side of RPC sends requests. It\u0026rsquo;s called Channel rather than \u0026ldquo;Client\u0026rdquo; in brpc. A channel represents a communication line to one server or multiple servers, which can be used for calling services.\nA Channel can be shared by all threads in the process. Yon don\u0026rsquo;t need to create separate Channels for each thread, and you don\u0026rsquo;t need to synchronize Channel.CallMethod with lock. However creation and destroying of Channel is not thread-safe, make sure the channel is initialized and destroyed only by one thread.\nSome RPC implementations have so-called \u0026ldquo;ClientManager\u0026rdquo;, including configurations and resource management at the client-side, which is not needed by brpc. \u0026ldquo;thread-num\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;connection-type\u0026rdquo; such parameters are either in brpc::ChannelOptions or global gflags. Advantages of doing so:\nConvenience. You don\u0026rsquo;t have to pass a \u0026ldquo;ClientManager\u0026rdquo; when the Channel is created, and you don\u0026rsquo;t have to store the \u0026ldquo;ClientManager\u0026rdquo;. Otherwise code has to pass \u0026ldquo;ClientManager\u0026rdquo; layer by layer, which is troublesome. gflags makes configurations of global behaviors easier. Share resources. For example, servers and channels in brpc share background workers (of bthread). Better management of Lifetime. Destructing a \u0026ldquo;ClientManager\u0026rdquo; is very error-prone, which is managed by brpc right now. Like most classes, Channel must be Init()-ed before usage. Parameters take default values when options is NULL. If you want non-default values, code as follows:\nbrpc::ChannelOptions options; // including default values options.xxx = yyy; ... channel.Init(..., \u0026amp;options); Note that Channel neither modifies options nor accesses options after completion of Init(), thus options can be put on stack safely as in above code. Channel.options() gets options being used by the Channel.\nInit() can connect one server or a cluster(multiple servers).\nConnect to a server // Take default values when options is NULL. int Init(EndPoint server_addr_and_port, const ChannelOptions* options); int Init(const char* server_addr_and_port, const ChannelOptions* options); int Init(const char* server_addr, int port, const ChannelOptions* options); The server connected by these Init() has fixed address genrally. The creation does not need NamingService or LoadBalancer, being relatively light-weight. The address could be a hostname, but don\u0026rsquo;t frequently create Channels connecting to a hostname, which requires a DNS lookup taking at most 10 seconds. (default timeout of DNS lookup). Reuse them.\nValid \u0026ldquo;server_addr_and_port\u0026rdquo;:\n127.0.0.1:80 www.foo.com:8765 localhost:9000 Invalid \u0026ldquo;server_addr_and_port\u0026rdquo;:\n127.0.0.1:90000 # too large port 10.39.2.300:8000 # invalid IP Connect to a cluster int Init(const char* naming_service_url, const char* load_balancer_name, const ChannelOptions* options); Channels created by above Init() get server list from the NamingService specified by naming_service_url periodically or driven-by-events, and send request to one server chosen from the list according to the algorithm specified by load_balancer_name .\nYou should not create such channels ad-hocly each time before a RPC, because creation and destroying of such channels relate to many resources, say NamingService needs to be accessed once at creation otherwise server candidates are unknown. On the other hand, channels are able to be shared by multiple threads safely and has no need to be created frequently.\nIf load_balancer_name is NULL or empty, this Init() is just the one for connecting single server and naming_service_url should be \u0026ldquo;ip:port\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;host:port\u0026rdquo; of the server. Thus you can unify initialization of all channels with this Init(). For example, you can put values of naming_service_url and load_balancer_name in configuration file, and set load_balancer_name to empty for single server and a valid algorithm for a cluster.\nNaming Service Naming service maps a name to a modifiable list of servers. It\u0026rsquo;s positioned as follows at client-side:\nWith the help of naming service, the client remembers a name instead of every concrete server. When the servers are added or removed, only mapping in the naming service is changed, rather than telling every client that may access the cluster. This process is called \u0026ldquo;decoupling up and downstreams\u0026rdquo;. Back to implementation details, the client does remember every server and will access NamingService periodically or be pushed with latest server list. The impl. has minimal impact on RPC latencies and very small pressure on the system providing naming service.\nGeneral form of naming_service_url is \u0026ldquo;protocol://service_name\u0026rdquo;.\nbns://\u0026lt;bns-name\u0026gt; BNS is the most common naming service inside Baidu. In \u0026ldquo;bns://rdev.matrix.all\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;bns\u0026rdquo; is protocol and \u0026ldquo;rdev.matrix.all\u0026rdquo; is service-name. A related gflag is -ns_access_interval: If the list in BNS is non-empty, but Channel says \u0026ldquo;no servers\u0026rdquo;, the status bit of the machine in BNS is probably non-zero, which means the machine is unavailable and as a correspondence not added as server candidates of the Channel. Status bits can be checked by:\nget_instance_by_service [bns_node_name] -s\nfile://\u0026lt;path\u0026gt; Servers are put in the file specified by path. For example, in \u0026ldquo;file://conf/machine_list\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;conf/machine_list\u0026rdquo; is the file:\nin which each line is address of a server. contents after # are comments and ignored. non-comment contents after addresses are tags, which are separated from addresses by one or more spaces, same address + different tags are treated as different instances. brpc reloads the file when it\u0026rsquo;s updated. # This line is ignored 10.24.234.17:8080 tag1 # a comment 10.24.234.17:8090 tag2 # an instance different from the instance on last line 10.24.234.18:8080 10.24.234.19:8080 Pros: easy to modify, convenient for unittests.\nCons: need to update every client when the list changes, not suitable for online deployment.\nlist://\u0026lt;addr1\u0026gt;,\u0026lt;addr2\u0026gt;\u0026hellip; Servers are directly written after list://, separated by comma.

Same address + different tags are treated as different instances.\nPros: directly configurable in CLI, convenient for unittests.\nCons: cannot be updated at runtime, not suitable for online deployment at all.\nhttp://\u0026lt;url\u0026gt; Connect all servers under the domain, for example: http://www.baidu.com:80.\nNote: although Init() for connecting single server(2 parameters) accepts hostname as well, it only connects one server under the domain.\nPros: Versatility of DNS, useable both in private or public network.\nCons: limited by transmission formats of DNS, unable to implement notification mechanisms.\nhttps://\u0026lt;url\u0026gt; Similar with \u0026ldquo;http\u0026rdquo; prefix besides that the connections will be encrypted with SSL.\nconsul://\u0026lt;service-name\u0026gt; Get a list of servers with the specified service-name through consul. The default address of consul is localhost:8500, which can be modified by setting -consul_agent_addr in gflags. The connection timeout of consul is 200ms by default, which can be modified by -consul_connect_timeout_ms.\nBy default, stale and passing(only servers with passing in statuses are returned) are added to parameters of the consul request, which can be modified by -consul_url_parameter in gflags.\nExcept the first request to consul, the follow-up requests use the long polling feature. That is, the consul responds only when the server list is updated or the request times out. The timeout defaults to 60 seconds, which can be modified by -consul_blocking_query_wait_secs.\nIf the server list returned by the consul does not follow response format, or all servers in the list are filtered because the key fields such as the address and port are missing or cannot be parsed, the server list will not be updated and the consul service will be revisited after a period of time(default 500ms, can be modified by -consul_retry_interval_ms）.\nIf consul is not accessible, the naming service can be automatically downgraded to file naming service. This feature is turned off by default and can be turned on by setting -consul_enable_degrade_to_file_naming_service. After downgrading, in the directory specified by -consul_file_naming_service_dir, the file whose name is the service-name will be used. This file can be generated by the consul-template, which holds the latest server list before the consul is unavailable. The consul naming service is automatically restored when consul is restored.\nMore naming services User can extend to more naming services by implementing brpc::NamingService, check this link for details.\nThe tag in naming service Every address can be attached with a tag. The common implementation is that if there\u0026rsquo;re spaces after the address, the content after the spaces is the tag. Same address with different tag are treated as different instances which are interacted with separate connections. Users can use this feature to establish connections with remote servers in a more flexible way. If you need weighted round-robin, you should consider using wrr algorithm first rather than emulate \u0026ldquo;a coarse-grained version\u0026rdquo; with tags.\nVIP related issues VIP is often the public IP of layer-4 load balancer, which proxies traffic to RS behide. When a client connects to the VIP, a connection is established to a chosen RS. When the client connection is broken, the connection to the RS is reset as well.\nIf one client establishes only one connection to the VIP(\u0026ldquo;single\u0026rdquo; connection type in brpc), all traffic from the client lands on one RS. If number of clients are large enough, each RS should gets many connections and roughly balanced, at least from the cluster perspective. However, if clients are not large enough or workload from clients are very different, some RS may be overloaded. Another issue is that when multiple VIP are listed together, the traffic to them may not be proportional to the number of RS behide them.\nOne solution to these issues is to use \u0026ldquo;pooled\u0026rdquo; connection type, so that one client may create multiple connections to one VIP (roughly the max concurrency recently) to make traffic land on different RS. If more than one VIP are present, consider using wrr load balancing to assign weights to different VIP, or add different tags to VIP to form more instances.\nIf higher performance is demanded, or number of connections is limited (in a large cluster), consider using single connection and attach same VIP with different tags to create different connections. Comparing to pooled connections, number of connections and overhead of syscalls are often lower, but if tags are not enough, RS hotspots may still present.\nNaming Service Filter Users can filter servers got from the NamingService before pushing to LoadBalancer.\nInterface of the filter:\n// naming_service_filter.h class NamingServiceFilter { public: // Return true to take this `server\u0026#39; as a candidate to issue RPC // Return false to filter it out virtual bool Accept(const ServerNode\u0026amp; server) const = 0; }; // naming_service.h struct ServerNode { butil::EndPoint addr; std::string tag; }; The most common usage is filtering by server tags.\nCustomized filter is set to ChannelOptions to take effects. NULL by default means not filter.\nclass MyNamingServiceFilter : public brpc::NamingServiceFilter { public: bool Accept(const brpc::ServerNode\u0026amp; server) const { return server.tag == \u0026#34;main\u0026#34;; } }; int main() { ... MyNamingServiceFilter my_filter; ... brpc::ChannelOptions options; options.ns_filter = \u0026amp;my_filter; ... } Load Balancer When there\u0026rsquo;re more than one server to access, we need to divide the traffic. The process is called load balancing, which is positioned as follows at client-side.\nThe ideal algorithm is to make every request being processed in-time, and crash of any server makes minimal impact. However clients are not able to know delays or congestions happened at servers in realtime, and load balancing algorithms should be light-weight generally, users need to choose proper algorithms for their use cases. Algorithms provided by brpc (specified by load_balancer_name):\nrr which is round robin. Always choose next server inside the list, next of the last server is the first one. No other settings. For example there\u0026rsquo;re 3 servers: a,b,c, brpc will send requests to a, b, c, a, b, c, … and so on. Note that presumption of using this algorithm is the machine specs, network latencies, server loads are similar.\nwrr which is weighted round robin. Choose the next server according to the configured weight. The chances a server is selected is consistent with its weight, and the algorithm can make each server selection scattered.\nThe instance tag must be an int32 number representing the weight, eg. tag=\u0026ldquo;50\u0026rdquo;.\nrandom Randomly choose one server from the list, no other settings. Similarly with round robin, the algorithm assumes that servers to access are similar.\nwr which is weighted random. Choose the next server according to the configured weight. The chances a server is selected is consistent with its weight.\nRequirements of instance tag is the same as wrr.\nla which is locality-aware. Perfer servers with lower latencies, until the latency is higher than others, no other settings. Check out Locality-aware load balancing for more details.\nc_murmurhash or c_md5 which is consistent hashing. Adding or removing servers does not make destinations of requests change as dramatically as in simple hashing. It\u0026rsquo;s especially suitable for caching services.\nNeed to set Controller.set_request_code() before RPC otherwise the RPC will fail. request_code is often a 32-bit hash code of \u0026ldquo;key part\u0026rdquo; of the request, and the hashing algorithm does not need to be same with the one used by load balancer. Say c_murmurhash can use md5 to compute request_code of the request as well.\nsrc/brpc/policy/hasher.h includes common hash functions. If std::string key stands for key part of the request, controller.set_request_code(brpc::policy::MurmurHash32(key.data(), key.size())) sets request_code correctly.\nDo distinguish \u0026ldquo;key\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;attributes\u0026rdquo; of the request. Don\u0026rsquo;t compute request_code by full content of the request just for quick. Minor change in attributes may result in totally different hash code and change destination dramatically. Another cause is padding, for example: struct Foo { int32_t a; int64_t b; } has a 4-byte undefined gap between a and b on 64-bit machines, result of hash(\u0026amp;foo, sizeof(foo)) is undefined. Fields need to be packed or serialized before hashing.\nCheck out Consistent Hashing for more details.\nOther kind of lb does not need to set Controller.set_request_code(). If request code is set, it will not be used by lb. For example, lb=rr, and call Controller.set_request_code(), even if request_code is the same for every request, lb will balance the requests using the rr policy.\nClient-side throttling for recovery from cluster downtime Cluster downtime refers to the state in which all servers in the cluster are unavailable. Due to the health check mechanism, when the cluster returns to normal, server will go online one by one. When a server is online, all traffic will be sent to it, which may cause the service to be overloaded again. If circuit breaker is enabled, server may be offline again before the other servers go online, and the cluster can never be recovered. As a solution, brpc provides a client-side throttling mechanism for recovery after cluster downtime. When no server is available in the cluster, the cluster enters recovery state. Assuming that the minimum number of servers that can serve all requests is min_working_instances, current number of servers available in the cluster is q, then in recovery state, the probability of client accepting the request is q/min_working_instances, otherwise it is discarded. If q remains unchanged for a period of time(hold_seconds), the traffic is resent to all available servers and leaves recovery state. Whether the request is rejected in recovery state is indicated by whether controller.ErrorCode() is equal to brpc::ERJECT, and the rejected request will not be retried by the framework.\nThis recovery mechanism requires the capabilities of downstream servers to be similar, so it is currently only valid for rr and random. The way to enable it is to add the values of min_working_instances and hold_seconds parameters after load_balancer_name, for example:\nchannel.Init(\u0026#34;http://...\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;random:min_working_instances=6 hold_seconds=10\u0026#34;, \u0026amp;options); Health checking Servers whose connections are lost are isolated temporarily to prevent them from being selected by LoadBalancer. brpc connects isolated servers periodically to test if they\u0026rsquo;re healthy again. The interval is controlled by gflag -health_check_interval:\nName Value Description Defined At health_check_interval (R) 3 seconds between consecutive health-checkings src/brpc/socket_map.cpp Once a server is connected, it resumes as a server candidate inside LoadBalancer. If a server is removed from NamingService during health-checking, brpc removes it from health-checking as well.\nLaunch RPC Generally, we don\u0026rsquo;t use Channel.CallMethod directly, instead we call XXX_Stub generated by protobuf, which feels more like a \u0026ldquo;method call\u0026rdquo;. The stub has few member fields, being suitable(and recommended) to be put on stack instead of new(). Surely the stub can be saved and re-used as well. Channel.CallMethod and stub are both thread-safe and accessible by multiple threads simultaneously. For example:\nXXX_Stub stub(\u0026amp;channel); stub.some_method(controller, request, response, done); Or even:\nXXX_Stub(\u0026amp;channel).some_method(controller, request, response, done); A exception is http/h2 client, which is not related to protobuf much. Call CallMethod directly to make a http call, setting all parameters to NULL except for Controller and done, check Access http/h2 for details.\nSynchronous call CallMethod blocks until response from server is received or error occurred (including timedout).\nresponse/controller in synchronous call will not be used by brpc again after CallMethod, they can be put on stack safely. Note: if request/response has many fields and being large on size, they\u0026rsquo;d better be allocated on heap.\nMyRequest request; MyResponse response; brpc::Controller cntl; XXX_Stub stub(\u0026amp;channel); request.set_foo(...); cntl.set_timeout_ms(...); stub.some_method(\u0026amp;cntl, \u0026amp;request, \u0026amp;response, NULL); if (cntl.Failed()) { // RPC failed. fields in response are undefined, don\u0026#39;t use. } else { // RPC succeeded, response has what we want. } WARNING: Do NOT use synchronous call when you are holding a pthread lock! Otherwise it is easy to cause deadlock.\nSolution (choose one of the two):\nReplace pthread lock with bthread lock (bthread_mutex_t) Release the lock before CallMethod Asynchronous call Pass a callback done to CallMethod, which resumes after sending request, rather than completion of RPC. When the response from server is received or error occurred(including timedout), done-\u0026gt;Run() is called. Post-processing code of the RPC should be put in done-\u0026gt;Run() instead of after CallMethod.\nBecause end of CallMethod does not mean completion of RPC, response/controller may still be used by brpc or done-\u0026gt;Run(). Generally they should be allocated on heap and deleted in done-\u0026gt;Run(). If they\u0026rsquo;re deleted too early, done-\u0026gt;Run() may access invalid memory.\nYou can new these objects individually and create done by NewCallback, or make response/controller be member of done and new them together. Former one is recommended.\nRequest can be destroyed immediately after asynchronous CallMethod. (SelectiveChannel is an exception, in the case of SelectiveChannel, the request object must be released after rpc finish)\nChannel can be destroyed immediately after asynchronous CallMethod.\nNote that \u0026ldquo;immediately\u0026rdquo; means destruction of Request/Channel can happen after CallMethod, not during CallMethod. Deleting a Channel just being used by another thread results in undefined behavior (crash at best).\nUse NewCallback static void OnRPCDone(MyResponse* response, brpc::Controller* cntl) { // unique_ptr helps us to delete response/cntl automatically. unique_ptr in gcc 3.4 is an emulated version. std::unique_ptr\u0026lt;MyResponse\u0026gt; response_guard(response); std::unique_ptr\u0026lt;brpc::Controller\u0026gt; cntl_guard(cntl); if (cntl-\u0026gt;Failed()) { // RPC failed. fields in response are undefined, don\u0026#39;t use. } else { // RPC succeeded, response has what we want. Continue the post-processing. } // Closure created by NewCallback deletes itself at the end of Run. } MyResponse* response = new MyResponse; brpc::Controller* cntl = new brpc::Controller; MyService_Stub stub(\u0026amp;channel); MyRequest request; // you don\u0026#39;t have to new request, even in an asynchronous call. request.set_foo(...); cntl-\u0026gt;set_timeout_ms(...); stub.some_method(cntl, \u0026amp;request, response, brpc::NewCallback(OnRPCDone, response, cntl)); Since protobuf 3 changes NewCallback to private, brpc puts NewCallback in src/brpc/callback.h after r32035 (and adds more overloads). If your program has compilation issues with NewCallback, replace google::protobuf::NewCallback with brpc::NewCallback.\nInherit google::protobuf::Closure Drawback of using NewCallback is that you have to allocate memory on heap at least 3 times: response, controller, done. If profiler shows that the memory allocation is a hotspot, you can consider inheriting Closure by your own, and enclose response/controller as member fields. Doing so combines 3 new into one, but the code will be worse to read. Don\u0026rsquo;t do this if memory allocation is not an issue.\nclass OnRPCDone: public google::protobuf::Closure { public: void Run() { // unique_ptr helps us to delete response/cntl automatically. unique_ptr in gcc 3.4 is an emulated version. std::unique_ptr\u0026lt;OnRPCDone\u0026gt; self_guard(this); if (cntl-\u0026gt;Failed()) { // RPC failed. fields in response are undefined, don\u0026#39;t use. } else { // RPC succeeded, response has what we want. Continue the post-processing. } } MyResponse response; brpc::Controller cntl; } OnRPCDone* done = new OnRPCDone; MyService_Stub stub(\u0026amp;channel); MyRequest request; // you don\u0026#39;t have to new request, even in an asynchronous call. request.set_foo(...); done-\u0026gt;cntl.set_timeout_ms(...); stub.some_method(\u0026amp;done-\u0026gt;cntl, \u0026amp;request, \u0026amp;done-\u0026gt;response, done); What will happen when the callback is very complicated? No special impact, the callback will run in separate bthread, without blocking other sessions. You can do all sorts of things in the callback.\nDoes the callback run in the same thread that CallMethod runs? The callback runs in a different bthread, even the RPC fails just after entering CallMethod. This avoids deadlock when the RPC is ongoing inside a lock(not recommended).\nWait for completion of RPC NOTE: ParallelChannel is probably more convenient to launch multiple RPCs in parallel.\nFollowing code starts 2 asynchronous RPC and waits them to complete.\nconst brpc::CallId cid1 = controller1-\u0026gt;call_id(); const brpc::CallId cid2 = controller2-\u0026gt;call_id(); ... stub.method1(controller1, request1, response1, done1); stub.method2(controller2, request2, response2, done2); ... brpc::Join(cid1); brpc::Join(cid2); Call Controller.call_id() to get an id before launching RPC, join the id after the RPC.\nJoin() blocks until completion of RPC and end of done-\u0026gt;Run(), properties of Join:\nIf the RPC is complete, Join() returns immediately. Multiple threads can Join() one id, all of them will be woken up. Synchronous RPC can be Join()-ed in another thread, although we rarely do this. Join() was called JoinResponse() before, if you meet deprecated issues during compilation, rename to Join().\nCalling Join(controller-\u0026gt;call_id()) after completion of RPC is wrong, do save call_id before RPC, otherwise the controller may be deleted by done at any time. The Join in following code is wrong.\nstatic void on_rpc_done(Controller* controller, MyResponse* response) { ... Handle response ... delete controller; delete response; } Controller* controller1 = new Controller; Controller* controller2 = new Controller; MyResponse* response1 = new MyResponse; MyResponse* response2 = new MyResponse; ... stub.method1(controller1, \u0026amp;request1, response1, google::protobuf::NewCallback(on_rpc_done, controller1, response1)); stub.method2(controller2, \u0026amp;request2, response2, google::protobuf::NewCallback(on_rpc_done, controller2, response2)); ... brpc::Join(controller1-\u0026gt;call_id()); // WRONG, controller1 may be deleted by on_rpc_done brpc::Join(controller2-\u0026gt;call_id()); // WRONG, controller2 may be deleted by on_rpc_done Semi-synchronous call Join can be used for implementing \u0026ldquo;Semi-synchronous\u0026rdquo; call: blocks until multiple asynchronous calls to complete. Since the callsite blocks until completion of all RPC, controller/response can be put on stack safely.\nbrpc::Controller cntl1; brpc::Controller cntl2; MyResponse response1; MyResponse response2; ... stub1.method1(\u0026amp;cntl1, \u0026amp;request1, \u0026amp;response1, brpc::DoNothing()); stub2.method2(\u0026amp;cntl2, \u0026amp;request2, \u0026amp;response2, brpc::DoNothing()); ... brpc::Join(cntl1.call_id()); brpc::Join(cntl2.call_id()); brpc::DoNothing() gets a closure doing nothing, specifically for semi-synchronous calls. Its lifetime is managed by brpc.\nNote that in above example, we access controller.call_id() after completion of RPC, which is safe right here, because DoNothing does not delete controller as in on_rpc_done in previous example.\nCancel RPC brpc::StartCancel(call_id) cancels corresponding RPC, call_id must be got from Controller.call_id() before launching RPC, race conditions may occur at any other time.\nNOTE: it is brpc::StartCancel(call_id), not controller-\u0026gt;StartCancel(), which is forbidden and useless. The latter one is provided by protobuf by default and has serious race conditions on lifetime of controller.\nAs the name implies, RPC may not complete yet after calling StartCancel, you should not touch any field in Controller or delete any associated resources, they should be handled inside done-\u0026gt;Run(). If you have to wait for completion of RPC in-place(not recommended), call Join(call_id).\nFacts about StartCancel:\ncall_id can be cancelled before CallMethod, the RPC will end immediately(and done will be called). call_id can be cancelled in another thread. Cancel an already-cancelled call_id has no effect. Inference: One call_id can be cancelled by multiple threads simultaneously, but only one of them takes effect. Cancel here is a client-only feature, the server-side may not cancel the operation necessarily, server cancelation is a separate feature. Get server-side address and port remote_side() tells where request was sent to, the return type is butil::EndPoint, which includes an ipv4 address and port. Calling this method before completion of RPC is undefined.\nHow to print:\nLOG(INFO) \u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0026#34;remote_side=\u0026#34; \u0026lt;\u0026lt; cntl-\u0026gt;remote_side(); printf(\u0026#34;remote_side=%s\\n\u0026#34;, butil::endpoint2str(cntl-\u0026gt;remote_side()).c_str()); Get client-side address and port local_side() gets address and port of the client-side sending RPC after r31384\nHow to print:\nLOG(INFO) \u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0026#34;local_side=\u0026#34; \u0026lt;\u0026lt; cntl-\u0026gt;local_side(); printf(\u0026#34;local_side=%s\\n\u0026#34;, butil::endpoint2str(cntl-\u0026gt;local_side()).c_str()); Should brpc::Controller be reused? Not necessary to reuse deliberately.\nController has miscellaneous fields, some of them are buffers that can be re-used by calling Reset().\nIn most use cases, constructing a Controller(snippet1) and re-using a Controller(snippet2) perform similarily.\n// snippet1 for (int i = 0; i \u0026lt; n; ++i) { brpc::Controller controller; ... stub.CallSomething(..., \u0026amp;controller); } // snippet2 brpc::Controller controller; for (int i = 0; i \u0026lt; n; ++i) { controller.Reset(); ... stub.CallSomething(..., \u0026amp;controller); } If the Controller in snippet1 is new-ed on heap, snippet1 has extra cost of \u0026ldquo;heap allcation\u0026rdquo; and may be a little slower in some cases.\nSettings Client-side settings has 3 parts:\nbrpc::ChannelOptions: defined in src/brpc/channel.h, for initializing Channel, becoming immutable once the initialization is done. brpc::Controller: defined in src/brpc/controller.h, for overriding fields in brpc::ChannelOptions for some RPC according to contexts. global gflags: for tuning global behaviors, being unchanged generally. Read comments in /flags before setting. Controller contains data and options that request may not have. server and client share the same Controller class, but they may set different fields. Read comments in Controller carefully before using.\nA Controller corresponds to a RPC. A Controller can be re-used by another RPC after Reset(), but a Controller can\u0026rsquo;t be used by multiple RPC simultaneously, no matter the RPCs are started from one thread or not.\nProperties of Controller:\nA Controller can only have one user. Without explicit statement, methods in Controller are not thread-safe by default. Due to the fact that Controller is not shared generally, there\u0026rsquo;s no need to manage Controller by shared_ptr. If you do, something might goes wrong. Controller is constructed before RPC and destructed after RPC, some common patterns: Put Controller on stack before synchronous RPC, be destructed when out of scope. Note that Controller of asynchronous RPC must not be put on stack, otherwise the RPC may still run when the Controller is being destructed and result in undefined behavior. new Controller before asynchronous RPC, delete in done. Number of worker pthreads There\u0026rsquo;s no independent thread pool for client in brpc. All Channels and Servers share the same backing threads via bthread. Setting number of worker pthreads in Server works for Client as well if Server is in used. Or just specify the gflag -bthread_concurrency to set the global number of worker pthreads.\nTimeout ChannelOptions.timeout_ms is timeout in milliseconds for all RPCs via the Channel, Controller.set_timeout_ms() overrides value for one RPC. Default value is 1 second, Maximum value is 2^31 (about 24 days), -1 means wait indefinitely for response or connection error.\nChannelOptions.connect_timeout_ms is the timeout in milliseconds for establishing connections of RPCs over the Channel, and -1 means no deadline. This value is limited to be not greater than timeout_ms. Note that this connection timeout is different from the one in TCP, generally this one is smaller.\nNOTE1: timeout_ms in brpc is deadline, which means once it\u0026rsquo;s reached, the RPC ends without more retries. As a comparison, other implementations may have session timeouts and deadline timeouts. Do distinguish them before porting to brpc.\nNOTE2: error code of RPC timeout is **ERPCTIMEDOUT (1008) **, ETIMEDOUT is connection timeout and retriable.\nRetry ChannelOptions.max_retry is maximum retrying count for all RPC via the channel, Default value is 3, 0 means no retries. Controller.set_max_retry() overrides value for one RPC.\nController.retried_count() returns number of retries.\nController.has_backup_request() tells if backup_request was sent.\nServers tried before are not retried by best efforts\nConditions for retrying (AND relations):\nBroken connection. Timeout is not reached. Has retrying quota. Controller.set_max_retry(0) or ChannelOptions.max_retry = 0 disables retries. The retry makes sense. If the RPC fails due to request(EREQUEST), no retry will be done because server is very likely to reject the request again, retrying makes no sense here. Broken connection If the server does not respond and connection is good, retry is not triggered. If you need to send another request after some timeout, use backup request.\nHow it works: If response does not return within the timeout specified by backup_request_ms, send another request, take whatever the first returned. New request will be sent to a different server that never tried before by best efforts. NOTE: If backup_request_ms is greater than timeout_ms, backup request will never be sent. backup request consumes one retry. backup request does not imply a server-side cancellation.\nChannelOptions.backup_request_ms affects all RPC via the Channel, unit is milliseconds, Default value is -1(disabled), Controller.set_backup_request_ms() overrides value for one RPC.\nTimeout is not reached RPC will be ended soon after the timeout.\nHas retrying quota Controller.set_max_retry(0) or ChannelOptions.max_retry = 0 disables retries.\nThe retry makes sense If the RPC fails due to request(EREQUEST), no retry will be done because server is very likely to reject the request again, retrying makes no sense here.\nUsers can inherit brpc::RetryPolicy to customize conditions of retrying. For example brpc does not retry for http/h2 related errors by default. If you want to retry for HTTP_STATUS_FORBIDDEN(403) in your app, you can do as follows:\n#include \u0026lt;brpc/retry_policy.h\u0026gt; class MyRetryPolicy : public brpc::RetryPolicy { public: bool DoRetry(const brpc::Controller* cntl) const { if (cntl-\u0026gt;ErrorCode() == brpc::EHTTP \u0026amp;\u0026amp; // http/h2 error cntl-\u0026gt;http_response().status_code() == brpc::HTTP_STATUS_FORBIDDEN) { return true; } // Leave other cases to brpc. return brpc::DefaultRetryPolicy()-\u0026gt;DoRetry(cntl); } }; ... // Assign the instance to ChannelOptions.retry_policy. // NOTE: retry_policy must be kept valid during lifetime of Channel, and Channel does not retry_policy, so in most cases RetryPolicy should be created by singleton.. brpc::ChannelOptions options; static MyRetryPolicy g_my_retry_policy; options.retry_policy = \u0026amp;g_my_retry_policy; ... Some tips：\nGet response of the RPC by cntl-\u0026gt;response(). RPC deadline represented by ERPCTIMEDOUT is never retried, even it\u0026rsquo;s allowed by your derived RetryPolicy. Retrying should be conservative Due to maintaining costs, even very large scale clusters are deployed with \u0026ldquo;just enough\u0026rdquo; instances to survive major defects, namely offline of one IDC, which is at most 1/2 of all machines. However aggressive retries may easily make pressures from all clients double or even tripple against servers, and make the whole cluster down: More and more requests stuck in buffers, because servers can\u0026rsquo;t process them in-time. All requests have to wait for a very long time to be processed and finally gets timed out, as if the whole cluster is crashed. The default retrying policy is safe generally: unless the connection is broken, retries are rarely sent. However users are able to customize starting conditions for retries by inheriting RetryPolicy, which may turn retries to be \u0026ldquo;a storm\u0026rdquo;. When you customized RetryPolicy, you need to carefully consider how clients and servers interact and design corresponding tests to verify that retries work as expected.\nCircuit breaker Check out circuit_breaker for more details.\nProtocols The default protocol used by Channel is baidu_std, which is changeable by setting ChannelOptions.protocol. The field accepts both enum and string.\nSupported protocols:\nPROTOCOL_BAIDU_STD or \u0026ldquo;baidu_std\u0026rdquo;, which is the standard binary protocol inside Baidu, using single connection by default.

PROTOCOL_UBRPC_COMPACK or \u0026ldquo;ubrpc_compack\u0026rdquo;, which is protocol of public/ubrpc, packing with compack, using pooled connection by default. check out ubrpc (by protobuf) for details. A related protocol is PROTOCOL_UBRPC_MCPACK2 or ubrpc_mcpack2, packing with mcpack2.

PROTOCOL_ESP or \u0026ldquo;esp\u0026rdquo;, for accessing services with esp protocol, using pooled connection by default. Connection Type brpc supports following connection types:\nshort connection: Established before each RPC, closed after completion. Since each RPC has to pay the overhead of establishing connection, this type is used for occasionally launched RPC, not frequently launched ones. No protocol use this type by default. Connections in http/1.0 are handled similarly as short connections. pooled connection: Pick an unused connection from a pool before each RPC, return after completion. One connection carries at most one request at the same time. One client may have multiple connections to one server. http/1.1 and the protocols using nshead use this type by default. single connection: all clients in one process has at most one connection to one server, one connection may carry multiple requests at the same time. The sequence of received responses does not need to be same as sending requests. This type is used by baidu_std, hulu_pbrpc, sofa_pbrpc by default. short connection pooled connection single connection long connection no yes yes #connection at server-side (from a client) qps*latency (little\u0026rsquo;s law) qps*latency 1 peak qps bad, and limited by max number of ports medium high latency 1.5RTT(connect) + 1RTT + processing time 1RTT + processing time 1RTT + processing time cpu usage high, tcp connect for each RPC medium, every request needs a sys write low, writes can be combined to reduce overhead. brpc chooses best connection type for the protocol by default, users generally have no need to change it. If you do, set ChannelOptions.connection_type to:\nCONNECTION_TYPE_SINGLE or \u0026ldquo;single\u0026rdquo; : single connection\nCONNECTION_TYPE_POOLED or \u0026ldquo;pooled\u0026rdquo;: pooled connection. Max number of pooled connections from one client to one server is limited by -max_connection_pool_size. Note the number is not same as \u0026ldquo;max number of connections\u0026rdquo;. New connections are always created when there\u0026rsquo;s no idle ones in the pool; the returned connections are closed immediately when the pool already has max_connection_pool_size connections. Value of max_connection_pool_size should respect the concurrency, otherwise the connnections that can\u0026rsquo;t be pooled are created and closed frequently which behaves similarly as short connections. If max_connection_pool_size is 0, the pool behaves just like fully short connections.\nName Value Description Defined At max_connection_pool_size (R) 100 Max number of pooled connections to a single endpoint src/brpc/socket.cpp CONNECTION_TYPE_SHORT or \u0026ldquo;short\u0026rdquo; : short connection\n\u0026quot;\u0026quot; (empty string) makes brpc chooses the default one.\nbrpc also supports Streaming RPC which is an application-level connection for transferring streaming data.\nClose idle connections in pools If a connection has no read or write within the seconds specified by -idle_timeout_second, it\u0026rsquo;s tagged as \u0026ldquo;idle\u0026rdquo;, and will be closed automatically. Default value is 10 seconds. This feature is only effective to pooled connections. If -log_idle_connection_close is true, a log is printed before closing.\nName Value Description Defined At idle_timeout_second 10 Pooled connections without data transmission for so many seconds will be closed. No effect for non-positive values src/brpc/socket_map.cpp log_idle_connection_close false Print log when an idle connection is closed src/brpc/socket.cpp Defer connection close Multiple channels may share a connection via referential counting. When a channel releases last reference of the connection, the connection will be closed. But in some scenarios, channels are created just before sending RPC and destroyed after completion, in which case connections are probably closed and re-open again frequently, as costly as short connections.\nOne solution is to cache channels commonly used by user, which avoids frequent creation and destroying of channels. However brpc does not offer an utility for doing this right now, and it\u0026rsquo;s not trivial for users to implement it correctly.\nAnother solution is setting gflag -defer_close_second\nName Value Description Defined At defer_close_second 0 Defer close of connections for so many seconds even if the connection is not used by anyone. Close immediately for non-positive values src/brpc/socket_map.cpp After setting, connection is not closed immediately after last referential count, instead it will be closed after so many seconds. If a channel references the connection again during the wait, the connection resumes to normal. No matter how frequent channels are created, this flag limits the frequency of closing connections. Side effect of the flag is that file descriptors are not closed immediately after destroying of channels, if the flag is wrongly set to be large, number of active file descriptors in the process may be large as well.\nBuffer size of connections -socket_recv_buffer_size sets receiving buffer size of all connections, -1 by default (not modified)\n-socket_send_buffer_size sets sending buffer size of all connections, -1 by default (not modified)\nName Value Description Defined At socket_recv_buffer_size -1 Set the recv buffer size of socket if this value is positive src/brpc/socket.cpp socket_send_buffer_size -1 Set send buffer size of sockets if this value is positive src/brpc/socket.cpp log_id set_log_id() sets a 64-bit integral log_id, which is sent to the server-side along with the request, and often printed in server logs to associate different services accessed in a session. String-type log-id must be converted to 64-bit integer before setting.\nAttachment baidu_std and hulu_pbrpc supports attachments which are sent along with messages and set by users to bypass serialization of protobuf. As a client, data set in Controller::request_attachment() will be received by server and response_attachment() contains attachment sent back by the server.\nAttachment is not compressed by framework.\nIn http/h2, attachment corresponds to message body, namely the data to post to server is stored in request_attachment().\nTurn on SSL Update openssl to the latest version before turning on SSL, since older versions of openssl may have severe security problems and support less encryption algorithms, which is against with the purpose of using SSL. Set ChannelOptions.mutable_ssl_options() to enable SSL. Refer to ssl_options.h for the detailed options. ChannelOptions.has_ssl_options() checks if ssl_options was set; ChannelOptions.ssl_options() returns const reference to the ssl_options.\n// Enable client-side SSL and use default values. options.mutable_ssl_options(); // Enable client-side SSL and customize values. options.mutable_ssl_options()-\u0026gt;ciphers_name = \u0026#34;...\u0026#34;; options.mutable_ssl_options()-\u0026gt;sni_name = \u0026#34;...\u0026#34;; Channels connecting to a single server or a cluster both support SSL (the initial implementation does not support cluster) After turning on SSL, all requests through this Channel will be encrypted. Users should create another Channel for non-SSL requests if needed. Accessibility improvements for HTTPS: Channel.Init recognizes https:// prefix and turns on SSL automatically; -http_verbose prints certificate information when SSL is on. Authentication Generally there are 2 ways of authentication at the client side:\nRequest-based authentication: Each request carries authentication information. It\u0026rsquo;s more flexible since the authentication information can contain fields based on this particular request. However, this leads to a performance loss due to the extra payload in each request. Connection-based authentication: Once a TCP connection has been established, the client sends an authentication packet. After it has been verfied by the server, subsequent requests on this connection no longer needs authentication. Compared with the former, this method can only carry some static information such as local IP in the authentication packet. However, it has better performance especially under single connection / connection pool scenario. It\u0026rsquo;s very simple to implement the first method by just adding authentication data format into the request proto definition. Then send it as normal RPC in each request. To achieve the second one, brpc provides an interface for users to implement:\nclass Authenticator { public: virtual ~Authenticator() {} // Implement this method to generate credential information // into `auth_str\u0026#39; which will be sent to `VerifyCredential\u0026#39; // at server side. This method will be called on client side. // Returns 0 on success, error code otherwise virtual int GenerateCredential(std::string* auth_str) const = 0; }; When the user calls the RPC interface with a single connection to the same server, the framework guarantee that once the TCP connection has been established, the first request on the connection will contain the authentication string generated by GenerateCredential. Subsequent requests will not carried that string. The entire sending process is still highly concurrent since it won\u0026rsquo;t wait for the authentication result. If the verification succeeds, all requests return without error. Otherwise, if the verification fails, generally the server will close the connection and those requests will receive the corresponding error.\nCurrently only those protocols support client authentication: baidu_std (default protocol), HTTP, hulu_pbrpc, ESP. For customized protocols, generally speaking, users could call the Authenticator\u0026rsquo;s interface to generate authentication string during the request packing process in order to support authentication.\nReset This method makes Controller back to the state as if it\u0026rsquo;s just created.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t call Reset() during a RPC, which is undefined.\nCompression set_request_compress_type() sets compress-type of the request, no compression by default.\nNOTE: Attachment is not compressed by brpc.\nCheck out compress request body to compress http/h2 body.\nSupported compressions:\nbrpc::CompressTypeSnappy : snanpy, compression and decompression are very fast, but compression ratio is low. brpc::CompressTypeGzip : gzip, significantly slower than snappy, with a higher compression ratio. brpc::CompressTypeZlib : zlib, 10%~20% faster than gzip but still significantly slower than snappy, with slightly better compression ratio than gzip.

No. Local TCP sockets performs just a little slower than unix domain socket since traffic over local TCP sockets bypasses network. Some scenarios where TCP sockets can\u0026rsquo;t be used may require unix domain sockets. We may consider the capability in future.\nQ: Fail to connect to xx.xx.xx.xx:xxxx, Connection refused The remote server does not serve any more (probably crashed).\nQ: often met Connection timedout to another IDC The TCP connection is not established within connection_timeout_ms, you have to tweak options:\nstruct ChannelOptions { ... // Issue error when a connection is not established after so many // milliseconds. -1 means wait indefinitely. // Default: 200 (milliseconds) // Maximum: 0x7fffffff (roughly 30 days) int32_t connect_timeout_ms; // Max duration of RPC over this Channel. -1 means wait indefinitely. // Overridable by Controller.set_timeout_ms(). // Default: 500 (milliseconds) // Maximum: 0x7fffffff (roughly 30 days) int32_t timeout_ms; ... }; NOTE: Connection timeout is not RPC timeout, which is printed as \u0026ldquo;Reached timeout=\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;.\nQ: synchronous call is good, asynchronous call crashes Check lifetime of Controller, Response and done. In asynchronous call, finish of CallMethod is not completion of RPC which is entering of done-\u0026gt;Run(). So the objects should not deleted just after CallMethod, instead they should be delete in done-\u0026gt;Run(). Generally you should allocate the objects on heap instead of putting them on stack. Check out Asynchronous call for details.\nQ: How to make requests be processed once and only once This issue is not solved on RPC layer. When response returns and being successful, we know the RPC is processed at server-side. When response returns and being rejected, we know the RPC is not processed at server-side. But when response is not returned, server may or may not process the RPC. If we retry, same request may be processed twice at server-side. Generally RPC services with side effects must consider idempotence of the service, otherwise retries may make side effects be done more than once and result in unexpected behavior. Search services with only read often have no side effects (during a search), being idempotent natually. But storage services that need to write have to design versioning or serial-number mechanisms to reject side effects that already happen, to keep idempoent.\nQ: Invalid address=`bns://group.user-persona.dumi.nj03' FATAL 04-07 20:00:03 7778 src/brpc/channel.cpp:123] Invalid address=`bns://group.user-persona.dumi.nj03\u0026#39;. You should use Init(naming_service_name, load_balancer_name, options) to access multiple servers. Accessing servers under naming service needs the Init() with 3 parameters(the second param is load_balancer_name). The Init() here is with 2 parameters and treated by brpc as accessing single server, producing the error.\nQ: Both sides use protobuf, why can\u0026rsquo;t they communicate with each other protocol != protobuf. protobuf serializes one package and a message of a protocol may contain multiple packages along with extra lengths, checksums, magic numbers. The capability offered by brpc that \u0026ldquo;write code once and serve multiple protocols\u0026rdquo; is implemented by converting data from different protocols to unified API, not on protobuf layer.\nQ: Why C++ client/server may fail to talk to client/server in other languages Check if the C++ version turns on compression (Controller::set_compress_type), Currently RPC impl. in other languages do not support compression yet.\nPS: Workflow at Client-side Steps:\nCreate a bthread_id as correlation_id of current RPC. According to how the Channel is initialized, choose a server from global SocketMap or LoadBalancer as destination of the request. Choose a Socket according to connection type (single, pooled, short) If authentication is turned on and the Socket is not authenticated yet, first request enters authenticating branch, other requests block until the branch writes authenticating information into the Socket. Server-side only verifies the first request. According to protocol of the Channel, choose corresponding serialization callback to serialize request into IOBuf. If timeout is set, setup timer. From this point on, avoid using Controller, since the timer may be triggered at anytime and calls user\u0026rsquo;s callback for timeout, which may delete Controller. Sending phase is completed. If error occurs at any step, Channel::HandleSendFailed is called. Write IOBuf with serialized data into the Socket and add Channel::HandleSocketFailed into id_wait_list of the Socket. The callback will be called when the write is failed or connection is broken before completion of RPC. In synchronous call, Join correlation_id; otherwise CallMethod() returns. Send/receive messages to/from network. After receiving response, get the correlation_id inside, find out associated Controller within O(1) time. The lookup does not need to lock a global hashmap, and scales well. Parse response according to the protocol Call Controller::OnRPCReturned, which may retry errorous RPC, or complete the RPC. Call user\u0026rsquo;s done in asynchronous call. Destroy correlation_id and wakeup joining threads. ","excerpt":"Example client-side code of echo.\nQuick facts Channel.Init() is not thread-safe. …","ref":"https://brpc.incubator.apache.org/docs/client/basics/","title":"Basics"},{"body":"Example server-side code of Echo.\nFill the .proto Interfaces of requests, responses, services are defined in proto files.\n# Tell protoc to generate base classes for C++ Service. modify to java_generic_services or py_generic_services for java or python. option cc_generic_services = true; message EchoRequest { required string message = 1; }; message EchoResponse { required string message = 1; }; service EchoService { rpc Echo(EchoRequest) returns (EchoResponse); }; Read official documents on protobuf for more details about protobuf.\nImplement generated interface protoc generates echo.pb.cc and echo.pb.h.

If any required field is not set, the RPC will fail.\ndone\nCreated by brpc and passed to service\u0026rsquo;s CallMethod(), including all actions after leaving CallMethod(): validating response, serialization, sending back to client etc.\nNo matter the RPC is successful or not, done-\u0026gt;Run() must be called by user once and only once when the RPC is done.\nWhy does brpc not call done-\u0026gt;Run() automatically? Because users are able to store done somewhere and call done-\u0026gt;Run() in some event handlers after leaving CallMethod(), which is an asynchronous service.\nWe strongly recommend using ClosureGuard to make done-\u0026gt;Run() always be called. Look at the beginning statement in above code snippet:\nbrpc::ClosureGuard done_guard(done); Not matter the callback is exited from middle or end, done_guard will be destructed, in which done-\u0026gt;Run() is called. The mechanism is called RAII. Without done_guard, you have to remember to add done-\u0026gt;Run() before each return, which is very error-prone.\nIn asynchronous service, request is not processed completely when CallMethod() returns, thus done-\u0026gt;Run() should not be called, instead it should be preserved somewhere and called later. At first glance, we don\u0026rsquo;t need ClosureGuard here. However in real applications, asynchronous service may fail in the middle and exit CallMethod() as well. Without ClosureGuard, error branches may forget to call done-\u0026gt;Run() before return. Thus done_guard is still recommended in asynchronous services. Different from synchronous services, to prevent done-\u0026gt;Run() from being called at successful return of CallMethod, you should call done_guard.release() to remove done from the object.\nHow synchronous and asynchronous services handle done generally:\nclass MyFooService: public FooService { public: // Synchronous void SyncFoo(::google::protobuf::RpcController* cntl_base, const ::example::EchoRequest* request, ::example::EchoResponse* response, ::google::protobuf::Closure* done) { brpc::ClosureGuard done_guard(done); ... } // Aynchronous void AsyncFoo(::google::protobuf::RpcController* cntl_base, const ::example::EchoRequest* request, ::example::EchoResponse* response, ::google::protobuf::Closure* done) { brpc::ClosureGuard done_guard(done); ... done_guard.release(); } }; Interface of ClosureGuard:\n// RAII: Call Run() of the closure on destruction. class ClosureGuard { public: ClosureGuard(); // Constructed with a closure which will be Run() inside dtor. explicit ClosureGuard(google::protobuf::Closure* done); // Call Run() of internal closure if it\u0026#39;s not NULL. ~ClosureGuard(); // Call Run() of internal closure if it\u0026#39;s not NULL and set it to `done\u0026#39;. void reset(google::protobuf::Closure* done); // Set internal closure to NULL and return the one before set. google::protobuf::Closure* release(); }; Set RPC to be failed Call Controller.SetFailed() to set the RPC to be failed. If error occurs during sending response, framework calls the method as well. Users often call the method in services\u0026rsquo; CallMethod(), For example if a stage of processing fails, user calls SetFailed() and call done-\u0026gt;Run(), then quit CallMethod (If ClosureGuard is used, done-\u0026gt;Run() is called automatically). The server-side done is created by framework and contains code sending response back to client. If SetFailed() is called, error information is sent to client instead of normal content. When client receives the response, its controller will be SetFailed() as well and Controller::Failed() will be true. In addition, Controller::ErrorCode() and Controller::ErrorText() are error code and error information respectively.\nUser may set status-code for http calls by calling controller.http_response().set_status_code() at server-side. Standard status-code are defined in http_status_code.h. Controller.SetFailed() sets status-code as well with the value closest to the error-code in semantics. brpc::HTTP_STATUS_INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR(500) is chosen when there\u0026rsquo;s no proper value.\nGet address of client controller-\u0026gt;remote_side() gets address of the client which sent the request. The return type is butil::EndPoint. If client is nginx, remote_side() is address of nginx. To get address of the \u0026ldquo;real\u0026rdquo; client before nginx, set proxy_header ClientIp $remote_addr; in nginx and call controller-\u0026gt;http_request().GetHeader(\u0026quot;ClientIp\u0026quot;) in RPC to get the address.\nPrinting method:\nLOG(INFO) \u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0026#34;remote_side=\u0026#34; \u0026lt;\u0026lt; cntl-\u0026gt;remote_side(); printf(\u0026#34;remote_side=%s\\n\u0026#34;, butil::endpoint2str(cntl-\u0026gt;remote_side()).c_str()); Get address of server controller-\u0026gt;local_side() gets server-side address of the RPC connection, return type is butil::EndPoint.\nPrinting method:\nLOG(INFO) \u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0026#34;local_side=\u0026#34; \u0026lt;\u0026lt; cntl-\u0026gt;local_side(); printf(\u0026#34;local_side=%s\\n\u0026#34;, butil::endpoint2str(cntl-\u0026gt;local_side()).c_str()); Asynchronous Service In which done-\u0026gt;Run() is called after leaving service\u0026rsquo;s CallMethod().\nSome server proxies requests to back-end servers and waits for responses that may come back after a long time. To make better use of threads, save done in corresponding event handlers which are triggered after CallMethod() and call done-\u0026gt;Run() inside. This kind of service is asynchronous.\nLast line of asynchronous service is often done_guard.release() to prevent done-\u0026gt;Run() from being called at successful exit from CallMethod(). Check out example/session_data_and_thread_local for a example.\nServer-side and client-side both use done to represent the continuation code after leaving CallMethod, but they\u0026rsquo;re totally different:\nserver-side done is created by framework, called by user after processing of the request to send back response to client. client-side done is created by user, called by framework to run post-processing code written by user after completion of RPC. In an asynchronous service that may access other services, user probably manipulates both kinds of done, be careful.\nAdd Service A just default-constructed Server neither contains service nor serves requests, merely an object.\nAdd a service with following method:\nint AddService(google::protobuf::Service* service, ServiceOwnership ownership); If ownership is SERVER_OWNS_SERVICE, server deletes the service at destruction. To prevent the deletion, set ownership to SERVER_DOESNT_OWN_SERVICE.\nFollowing code adds MyEchoService:\nbrpc::Server server; MyEchoService my_echo_service; if (server.AddService(\u0026amp;my_echo_service, brpc::SERVER_DOESNT_OWN_SERVICE) != 0) { LOG(FATAL) \u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0026#34;Fail to add my_echo_service\u0026#34;; return -1; } You cannot add or remove services after the server is started.\nStart server Call following methods of Server to start serving.\nint Start(const char* ip_and_port_str, const ServerOptions* opt); int Start(EndPoint ip_and_port, const ServerOptions* opt); int Start(int port, const ServerOptions* opt); int Start(const char *ip_str, PortRange port_range, const ServerOptions *opt); // r32009后增加 \u0026ldquo;localhost:9000\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;cq01-cos-dev00.cq01:8000\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;127.0.0.1:7000\u0026rdquo; are valid ip_and_port_str.\nAll parameters take default values if options is NULL. If you need non-default values, code as follows:\nbrpc::ServerOptions options; // with default values options.xxx = yyy; ... server.Start(..., \u0026amp;options); Listen to multiple ports One server can only listen to one port (not counting ServerOptions.internal_port). To listen to N ports, start N servers .\nMulti-process listening to one port When the reuse_port flag is turned on at startup, multiple processes can listen to one port (use SO_REUSEPORT internal).\nStop server server.Stop(closewait_ms); // closewait_ms is useless actually, not deleted due to compatibility server.Join(); Stop() does not block but Join() does. The reason for dividing them into two methods is: When multiple servers quit, users may Stop() all servers first, then Join() them together. Otherwise servers can only be Stop()+Join() one-by-one and the total waiting time may add up to number-of-servers times at worst.\nRegardless of the value of closewait_ms, server waits for all requests being processed before exiting and returns ELOGOFF errors to new requests immediately to prevent them from entering the service. The reason for the wait is that as long as the server is still processing requests, risk of accessing invalid(released) memory exists. If a Join() to a server \u0026ldquo;stucks\u0026rdquo;, some thread must be blocked on a request or done-\u0026gt;Run() is not called.\nWhen a client sees ELOGOFF, it skips the corresponding server and retry the request on another server. As a result, restarting a cluster with brpc clients/servers gradually should not lose traffic by default.\nRunUntilAskedToQuit() simplifies the code to run and stop servers in most cases. Following code runs the server until Ctrl-C is pressed.\n// Wait until Ctrl-C is pressed, then Stop() and Join() the server. server.RunUntilAskedToQuit(); // server is stopped, write the code for releasing resources. Services can be added or removed after Join() returns and server can be Start() again.\nAccessed by http/h2 Services using protobuf can be accessed via http/h2+json generally. The json string stored in body is convertible to/from corresponding protobuf message.\necho server as an example, is accessible from curl.\n# -H \u0026#39;Content-Type: application/json\u0026#39; is optional $ curl -d \u0026#39;{\u0026#34;message\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;hello\u0026#34;}\u0026#39; http://brpc.baidu.com:8765/EchoService/Echo {\u0026#34;message\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;hello\u0026#34;} Note: Set Content-Type: application/proto to access services with http/h2 + protobuf-serialized-data, which performs better at serialization.\njson\u0026lt;=\u0026gt;pb Json fields correspond to pb fields by matched names and message structures. The json must contain required fields in pb, otherwise conversion will fail and corresponding request will be rejected. The json may include undefined fields in pb, but they will be dropped rather than being stored in pb as unknown fields. Check out json \u0026lt;=\u0026gt; protobuf for conversion rules.\nWhen -pb_enum_as_number is turned on, enums in pb are converted to values instead of names. For example in enum MyEnum { Foo = 1; Bar = 2; };, fields typed MyEnum are converted to \u0026ldquo;Foo\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Bar\u0026rdquo; when the flag is off, 1 or 2 otherwise. This flag affects requests sent by clients and responses returned by servers both. Since \u0026ldquo;enum as name\u0026rdquo; has better forward and backward compatibilities, this flag should only be turned on to adapt legacy code that are unable to parse enumerations from names.\nAdapt old clients Early-version brpc allows pb service being accessed via http without filling the pb request, even if there\u0026rsquo;re required fields. This kind of service often parses http requests and sets http responses by itself, and does not touch the pb request. However this behavior is still very dangerous: a service with an undefined request.\nThis kind of services may meet issues after upgrading to latest brpc, which already deprecated the behavior for a long time. To help these services to upgrade, brpc allows bypassing the conversion from http body to pb request (so that users can parse http requests differently), the setting is as follows:\nbrpc::ServiceOptions svc_opt; svc_opt.ownership = ...; svc_opt.restful_mappings = ...; svc_opt.allow_http_body_to_pb = false; // turn off conversion from http/h2 body to pb request server.AddService(service, svc_opt); After the setting, service does not convert the body to pb request after receiving http/h2 request, which also makes the pb request undefined. Users have to parse the body by themselves when cntl-\u0026gt;request_protocol() == brpc::PROTOCOL_HTTP || cntl-\u0026gt;request_protocol() == brpc::PROTOCOL_H2 is true which indicates the request is from http/h2.\nAs a correspondence, if cntl-\u0026gt;response_attachment() is not empty and pb response is set as well, brpc does not report the ambiguous anymore, instead cntl-\u0026gt;response_attachment() will be used as body of the http/h2 response. This behavior is unaffected by setting allow_http_body_to_pb or not. If the relaxation results in more users\u0026rsquo; errors, we may restrict it in future.\nProtocols Server detects supported protocols automatically, without assignment from users. cntl-\u0026gt;protocol() gets the protocol being used. Server is able to accept connections with different protocols from one port, users don\u0026rsquo;t need to assign different ports for different protocols. Even one connection may transport messages in multiple protocols, although we rarely do this (and not recommend). Supported protocols:\nThe standard protocol used in Baidu, shown as \u0026ldquo;baidu_std\u0026rdquo;, enabled by default.\nStreaming RPC, shown as \u0026ldquo;streaming_rpc\u0026rdquo;, enabled by default.\nhttp/1.0 and http/1.1, shown as \u0026ldquo;http\u0026rdquo;, enabled by default.\nhttp/2 and gRPC, shown as \u0026ldquo;h2c\u0026rdquo;(unencrypted) or \u0026ldquo;h2\u0026rdquo;(encrypted), enabled by default.\nProtocol of RTMP, shown as \u0026ldquo;rtmp\u0026rdquo;, enabled by default.\nProtocol of hulu-pbrpc, shown as \u0026ldquo;hulu_pbrpc\u0026rdquo;, enabled by default.\nProtocol of sofa-pbrpc, shown as \u0026ldquo;sofa_pbrpc\u0026rdquo;, enabled by default.\nProtocol of Baidu ads union, shown as \u0026ldquo;nova_pbrpc\u0026rdquo;, disabled by default. Enabling method:\n#include \u0026lt;brpc/policy/nova_pbrpc_protocol.h\u0026gt; ... ServerOptions options; ... options.nshead_service = new brpc::policy::NovaServiceAdaptor; Protocol of public_pbrpc, shown as \u0026ldquo;public_pbrpc\u0026rdquo;, disabled by default. Enabling method:\n#include \u0026lt;brpc/policy/public_pbrpc_protocol.h\u0026gt; ... ServerOptions options; ... options.nshead_service = new brpc::policy::PublicPbrpcServiceAdaptor; Protocol of nshead+mcpack, shown as \u0026ldquo;nshead_mcpack\u0026rdquo;, disabled by default. Enabling method:\n#include \u0026lt;brpc/policy/nshead_mcpack_protocol.h\u0026gt; ... ServerOptions options; ... options.nshead_service = new brpc::policy::NsheadMcpackAdaptor; As the name implies, messages in this protocol are composed by nshead+mcpack, the mcpack does not include special fields. Different from implementations based on NsheadService by users, this protocol uses mcpack2pb which makes the service capable of handling both mcpack and pb with one piece of code. Due to lack of fields to carry ErrorText, server can only close connections when errors occur.\nRead Implement NsheadService for UB related protocols.\nIf you need more protocols, contact us.\nfork without exec In general, forked subprocess should call exec ASAP, before which only async-signal-safe functions should be called. brpc programs using fork like this should work correctly even in previous versions.\nBut in some scenarios, users continue the subprocess without exec. Since fork only copies its caller\u0026rsquo;s thread, which causes other threads to disappear after fork. In the case of brpc, bvar depends on a sampling_thread to sample various information, which disappears after fork and causes many bvars to be zeros.\nLatest brpc re-creates the thread after fork(when necessary) to make bvar work correctly, and can be forked again. A known problem is that the cpu profiler does not work after fork. However users still can\u0026rsquo;t call fork at any time, since brpc and its applications create threads extensively, which are not re-created after fork:\nmost fork continues with exec, which wastes re-creations bring too many troubles and complexities to the code brpc\u0026rsquo;s strategy is to create these threads on demand and fork without exec should happen before all code that may create the threads. Specifically, fork without exec should happen before initializing all Servers/Channels/Applications, earlier is better. fork not obeying this causes the program dysfunctional. BTW, fork without exec better be avoided because many libraries do not support it.\nSettings Version Server.set_version(…) sets name+version for the server, accessible from the builtin service /version. Although it\u0026rsquo;s called \u0026ldquo;version\u0026rdquo;, the string set is recommended to include the service name rather than just a numeric version.\nClose idle connections If a connection does not read or write within the seconds specified by ServerOptions.idle_timeout_sec, it\u0026rsquo;s treated as \u0026ldquo;idle\u0026rdquo; and will be closed by server soon. Default value is -1 which disables the feature.\nIf -log_idle_connection_close is turned on, a log will be printed before closing.\nName Value Description Defined At log_idle_connection_close false Print log when an idle connection is closed src/brpc/socket.cpp pid_file If this field is non-empty, Server creates a file named so at start-up, with pid as the content. Empty by default.\nPrint hostname in each line of log This feature only affects logging macros in butil/logging.h.\nIf -log_hostname is turned on, each line of log contains the hostname so that users know machines at where each line is generated from aggregated logs.\nCrash after printing FATAL log This feature only affects logging macros in butil/logging.h, glog crashes for FATAL log by default.\nIf -crash_on_fatal_log is turned on, program crashes after printing LOG(FATAL) or failed assertions by CHECK*(), and generates coredump (with proper environmental settings). Default value is false. This flag can be turned on in tests to make sure the program never hit critical errors.\nA common convention: use ERROR for tolerable errors, FATAL for unacceptable and permanent errors.\nMinimum log level This feature is implemented by butil/logging.h and glog separately, as a same-named gflag.\nOnly logs with levels not less than the level specified by -minloglevel are printed. This flag can be modified at run-time. Correspondence between values and log levels: 0=INFO 1=NOTICE 2=WARNING 3=ERROR 4=FATAL, default value is 0.\nOverhead of unprinted logs is just a \u0026ldquo;if\u0026rdquo; test and parameters are not evaluated (For example a parameter calls a function, if the log is not printed, the function is not called). Logs printed to LogSink may be filtered by the sink as well.\nReturn free memory to system Set gflag -free_memory_to_system_interval to make the program try to return free memory to system every so many seconds, values \u0026lt;= 0 disable the feature. Default value is 0. To turn it on, values \u0026gt;= 10 are recommended. This feature supports tcmalloc, thus MallocExtension::instance()-\u0026gt;ReleaseFreeMemory() periodically called in your program can be replaced by setting this flag.\nLog error to clients Framework does not print logs for specific client generally, because a lot of errors caused by clients may slow down server significantly due to frequent printing of logs. If you need to debug or just want the server to log all errors, turn on -log_error_text.\nCustomize percentiles of latency Latency percentiles showed are 80 (was 50 before), 90, 99, 99.9, 99.99 by default. The first 3 ones can be changed by gflags -bvar_latency_p1, -bvar_latency_p2, -bvar_latency_p3 respectively。\nFollowing are correct settings:\n-bvar_latency_p3=97 # p3 is changed from default 99 to 97 -bvar_latency_p1=60 -bvar_latency_p2=80 -bvar_latency_p3=95 Following are wrong settings:\n-bvar_latency_p3=100 # the value must be inside [1,99] inclusive，otherwise gflags fails to parse -bvar_latency_p1=-1 # ^ Change stacksize brpc server runs code in bthreads with stacksize=1MB by default, while stacksize of pthreads is 10MB. It\u0026rsquo;s possible that programs running normally on pthreads may meet stack overflow on bthreads.\nSet following gflags to enlarge the stacksize.\n--stack_size_normal=10000000 # sets stacksize to roughly 10MB --tc_stack_normal=1 # sets number of stacks cached by each worker pthread to prevent reusing from global pool each time, default value is 8 NOTE: It does mean that coredump of programs is likely to be caused by \u0026ldquo;stack overflow\u0026rdquo; on bthreads. We\u0026rsquo;re talking about this simply because it\u0026rsquo;s easy and quick to verify this factor and exclude the possibility.\nLimit sizes of messages To protect servers and clients, when a request received by a server or a response received by a client is too large, the server or client rejects the message and closes the connection. The limit is controlled by -max_body_size, in bytes.\nAn error log is printed when a message is too large and rejected:\nFATAL: 05-10 14:40:05: * 0 src/brpc/input_messenger.cpp:89] A message from 127.0.0.1:35217(protocol=baidu_std) is bigger than 67108864 bytes, the connection will be closed. Set max_body_size to allow bigger messages protobuf has similar limits and the error log is as follows:\nFATAL: 05-10 13:35:02: * 0 google/protobuf/io/coded_stream.cc:156] A protocol message was rejected because it was too big (more than 67108864 bytes). To increase the limit (or to disable these warnings), see CodedInputStream::SetTotalBytesLimit() in google/protobuf/io/coded_stream.h. brpc removes the restriction from protobuf and controls the limit by -max_body_size solely: as long as the flag is large enough, messages will not be rejected and error logs will not be printed. This feature works for all versions of protobuf.\nCompression set_response_compress_type() sets compression method for the response, no compression by default.\nAttachment is not compressed. Check here for compression of HTTP body.\nSupported compressions:\nbrpc::CompressTypeSnappy : snanpy, compression and decompression are very fast, but compression ratio is low. brpc::CompressTypeGzip : gzip, significantly slower than snappy, with a higher compression ratio. brpc::CompressTypeZlib : zlib, 10%~20% faster than gzip but still significantly slower than snappy, with slightly better compression ratio than gzip. Read Client-Compression for more comparisons.\nAttachment baidu_std and hulu_pbrpc supports attachments which are sent along with messages and set by users to bypass serialization of protobuf. From a server\u0026rsquo;s perspective, data set in Controller.response_attachment() will be received by the client while Controller.request_attachment() contains attachment sent from the client.\nAttachment is not compressed by framework.\nIn http, attachment corresponds to message body, namely the data to post to client is stored in response_attachment().\nTurn on SSL Update openssl to the latest version before turning on SSL, since older versions of openssl may have severe security problems and support less encryption algorithms, which is against with the purpose of using SSL. Setup ServerOptions.ssl_options to turn on SSL. Refer to ssl_options.h for more details.\n// Certificate structure struct CertInfo { // Certificate in PEM format. // Note that CN and alt subjects will be extracted from the certificate, // and will be used as hostnames. Requests to this hostname (provided SNI // extension supported) will be encrypted using this certifcate. // Supported both file path and raw string std::string certificate; // Private key in PEM format. // Supported both file path and raw string based on prefix: std::string private_key; // Additional hostnames besides those inside the certificate. Wildcards // are supported but it can only appear once at the beginning (i.e. *.xxx.com). std::vector\u0026lt;std::string\u0026gt; sni_filters; }; // SSL options at server side struct ServerSSLOptions { // Default certificate which will be loaded into server. Requests // without hostname or whose hostname doesn\u0026#39;t have a corresponding // certificate will use this certificate. MUST be set to enable SSL. CertInfo default_cert; // Additional certificates which will be loaded into server. These // provide extra bindings between hostnames and certificates so that // we can choose different certificates according to different hostnames. // See `CertInfo\u0026#39; for detail. std::vector\u0026lt;CertInfo\u0026gt; certs; // When set, requests without hostname or whose hostname can\u0026#39;t be found in // any of the cerficates above will be dropped. Otherwise, `default_cert\u0026#39; // will be used. // Default: false bool strict_sni; // ... Other options }; To turn on SSL, users MUST provide a default_cert. For dynamic certificate selection (i.e. based on request hostname, a.k.a SNI), certs should be used to store those dynamic certificates. Finally, users can add/remove those certificates when server\u0026rsquo;s running:\nint AddCertificate(const CertInfo\u0026amp; cert); int RemoveCertificate(const CertInfo\u0026amp; cert); int ResetCertificates(const std::vector\u0026lt;CertInfo\u0026gt;\u0026amp; certs); Other options include: cipher suites (recommend using ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384 which is the default suite used by chrome, and one of the safest suites. The drawback is more CPU cost), session reuse and so on.\nSSL layer works under protocol layer. As a result, all protocols (such as HTTP) can provide SSL access when it\u0026rsquo;s turned on. Server will decrypt the data first and then pass it into each protocol.\nAfter turning on SSL, non-SSL access is still available for the same port. Server can automatically distinguish SSL from non-SSL requests. SSL-only mode can be implemented using Controller::is_ssl() in service\u0026rsquo;s callback and SetFailed if it returns false. In the meanwhile, the builtin-service connections also shows the SSL information for each connection.\nVerify identities of clients The server needs to implement Authenticator to enable verifications:\nclass Authenticator { public: // Implement this method to verify credential information `auth_str\u0026#39; from // `client_addr\u0026#39;. You can fill credential context (result) into `*out_ctx\u0026#39; // and later fetch this pointer from `Controller\u0026#39;. // Returns 0 on success, error code otherwise virtual int VerifyCredential(const std::string\u0026amp; auth_str, const base::EndPoint\u0026amp; client_addr, AuthContext* out_ctx) const = 0; }; class AuthContext { public: const std::string\u0026amp; user() const; const std::string\u0026amp; group() const; const std::string\u0026amp; roles() const; const std::string\u0026amp; starter() const; bool is_service() const; }; The authentication is connection-specific. When server receives the first request from a connection, it tries to parse related information inside (such as auth field in baidu_std, Authorization header in HTTP), and call VerifyCredential along with address of the client. If the method returns 0, which indicates success, user can put verified information into AuthContext and access it via controller-\u0026gt;auth_context() later, whose lifetime is managed by framework. Otherwise the authentication is failed and the connection will be closed, which makes the client-side fail as well.\nSubsequent requests are treated as already verified without authenticating overhead.\nAssigning an instance of implemented Authenticator to ServerOptions.auth enables authentication. The instance must be valid during lifetime of the server.\nNumber of worker pthreads Controlled by ServerOptions.num_threads , number of cpu cores by default(including HT).\nNOTE: ServerOptions.num_threads is just a hint.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t think that Server uses exactly so many workers because all servers and channels in one process share worker pthreads. Total number of threads is the maximum of all ServerOptions.num_threads and bthread_concurrency. For example, a program has 2 servers with num_threads=24 and 36 respectively, and bthread_concurrency is 16. Then the number of worker pthreads is max (24, 36, 16) = 36, which is different from other RPC implementations which do summations generally.\nChannel does not have a corresponding option, but user can change number of worker pthreads at client-side by setting gflag -bthread_concurrency.\nIn addition, brpc does not separate \u0026ldquo;IO\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;processing\u0026rdquo; threads. brpc knows how to assemble IO and processing code together to achieve better concurrency and efficiency.\nLimit concurrency \u0026ldquo;Concurrency\u0026rdquo; may have 2 meanings: one is number of connections, another is number of requests processed simultaneously. Here we\u0026rsquo;re talking about the latter one.\nIn traditional synchronous servers, max concurreny is limited by number of worker pthreads. Setting number of workers also limits concurrency. But brpc processes new requests in bthreads and M bthreads are mapped to N workers (M \u0026gt; N generally), synchronous server may have a concurrency higher than number of workers. On the other hand, although concurrency of asynchronous server is not limited by number of workers in principle, we need to limit it by other factors sometimes.\nbrpc can limit concurrency at server-level and method-level. When number of requests processed by the server or method simultaneously would exceed the limit, server responds the client with brpc::ELIMIT directly instead of invoking the service. A client seeing ELIMIT should retry another server (by best efforts). This options avoids over-queuing of requests at server-side and limits related resources.\nDisabled by default.\nWhy issue error to the client instead of queuing the request when the concurrency hits limit? A server reaching max concurrency does not mean that other servers in the same cluster reach the limit as well. Let client be aware of the error ASAP and try another server is a better strategy from a cluster view.\nWhy not limit QPS? QPS is a second-level metric, which is not good at limiting sudden request bursts. Max concurrency is closely related to availability of critical resources: number of \u0026ldquo;workers\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;slots\u0026rdquo; etc, thus better at preventing over-queuing.\nIn addition, when a server has stable latencies, limiting concurrency has similar effect as limiting QPS due to little\u0026rsquo;s law. But the former one is much easier to implement: simple additions and minuses from a counter representing the concurrency. This is also the reason than most flow control is implemented by limiting concurrency rather than QPS. For example the window in TCP is a kind of concurrency.\nCalculate max concurrency max_concurrency = peak_qps * noload_latency (little\u0026rsquo;s law)\npeak_qps is the maximum of Queries-Per-Second. noload_latency is the average latency measured in a server without pushing to its limit(with an acceptable latency). peak_qps and nolaod_latency can be measured in pre-online performance tests and multiplied to calculate the max_concurrency.\nLimit server-level concurrency Set ServerOptions.max_concurrency. Default value is 0 which means not limited. Accesses to builtin services are not limited by this option.\nCall Server.ResetMaxConcurrency() to modify max_concurrency of the server after starting.\nLimit method-level concurrency server.MaxConcurrencyOf(\u0026quot;\u0026hellip;\u0026quot;) = … sets max_concurrency of the method. Possible settings:\nserver.MaxConcurrencyOf(\u0026#34;example.EchoService.Echo\u0026#34;) = 10; server.MaxConcurrencyOf(\u0026#34;example.EchoService\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Echo\u0026#34;) = 10; server.MaxConcurrencyOf(\u0026amp;service, \u0026#34;Echo\u0026#34;) = 10; The code is generally put after AddService, before Start() of the server. When a setting fails(namely the method does not exist), server will fail to start and notify user to fix settings on MaxConcurrencyOf.\nWhen method-level and server-level max_concurrency are both set, framework checks server-level first, then the method-level one.\nNOTE: No service-level max_concurrency.\nAutoConcurrencyLimiter max_concurrency may change over time and measuring and setting max_concurrency for all services before each deployment are probably very troublesome and impractical.\nAutoConcurrencyLimiter addresses on this issue by limiting concurrency for methods. To use the algorithm, set max_concurrency of the method to \u0026ldquo;auto\u0026rdquo;.\n// Set auto concurrency limiter for all methods brpc::ServerOptions options; options.method_max_concurrency = \u0026#34;auto\u0026#34;; // Set auto concurrency limiter for specific method server.MaxConcurrencyOf(\u0026#34;example.EchoService.Echo\u0026#34;) = \u0026#34;auto\u0026#34;; Read this to know more about the algorithm.\npthread mode User code(client-side done, server-side CallMethod) runs in bthreads with 1MB stacksize by default. But some of them cannot run in bthreads:\nJNI code checks stack layout and cannot be run in bthreads. The user code extensively use pthread-local to pass session-level data across functions. If there\u0026rsquo;s a synchronous RPC call or function calls that may block bthread, the resumed bthread may land on a different pthread which does not have the pthread-local data that users expect to have. As a contrast, although tcmalloc uses pthread(or LWP)-local as well, the code inside has nothing to do with bthread, which is safe. brpc offers pthread mode to solve the issues. When -usercode_in_pthread is turned on, user code will be run in pthreads. Functions that would block bthreads block pthreads.\nNote: With -usercode_in_pthread on, brpc::thread_local_data() does not guarantee to return valid value.\nPerformance issues when pthread mode is on:\nSince synchronous RPCs block worker pthreads, server often needs more workers (ServerOptions.num_threads), and scheduling efficiencies will be slightly lower. User code still runs in special bthreads actually, which use stacks of pthread workers. These special bthreads are scheduled same with normal bthreads and performance differences are negligible. bthread supports an unique feature: yield pthread worker to a newly created bthread to reduce a context switch. brpc client uses this feature to reduce number of context switches in one RPC from 3 to 2. In a performance-demanding system, reducing context-switches improves performance. However pthread-mode is not capable of doing this. Number of threads in pthread-mode is a hard limit. Once all threads are occupied, requests will be queued rapidly and many of them will be timed-out finally. An example: When many requests to downstream servers are timedout, the upstream services may also be severely affected by a lot of blocking threads waiting for responses(within timeout). Consider setting ServerOptions.max_concurrency to protect the server when pthread-mode is on. As a contrast, number of bthreads in bthread mode is a soft limit and reacts more smoothly to such kind of issues. pthread-mode lets legacy code to try brpc more easily, but we still recommend refactoring the code with bthread-local or even remove TLS gradually, to turn off the option in future.\nSecurity mode If requests are from public(including being proxied by nginx etc), you have to be aware of some security issues.\nHide builtin services from public Builtin services are useful, on the other hand include a lot of internal information and shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be exposed to public. There\u0026rsquo;re multiple methods to hide builtin services from public:\nSet internal port. Set ServerOptions.internal_port to a port which can only be accessible from internal. You can view builtin services via internal_port, while accesses from the public port (the one passed to Server.Start) should see following error:\n[a27eda84bcdeef529a76f22872b78305] Not allowed to access builtin services, try ServerOptions.internal_port=... instead if you\u0026#39;re inside internal network http proxies only proxy specified URLs. nginx etc is able to configure how to map different URLs to back-end servers. For example the configure below maps public traffic to /MyAPI to /ServiceName/MethodName of target-server. If builtin services like /status are accessed from public, nginx rejects the attempts directly.\nlocation /MyAPI { ... proxy_pass http://\u0026lt;target-server\u0026gt;/ServiceName/MethodName$query_string # $query_string is a nginx varible, check out http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html for more. ... } Don\u0026rsquo;t turn on -enable_dir_service and -enable_threads_service on public services. Although they\u0026rsquo;re convenient for debugging, they also expose too many information on the server. The script to check if the public service has enabled the options:\ncurl -s -m 1 \u0026lt;HOSTNAME\u0026gt;:\u0026lt;PORT\u0026gt;/flags/enable_dir_service,enable_threads_service | awk \u0026#39;{if($3==\u0026#34;false\u0026#34;){++falsecnt}else if($3==\u0026#34;Value\u0026#34;){isrpc=1}}END{if(isrpc!=1||falsecnt==2){print \u0026#34;SAFE\u0026#34;}else{print \u0026#34;NOT SAFE\u0026#34;}}\u0026#39; Disable built-in services completely Set ServerOptions.has_builtin_services = false, you can completely disable the built-in services.\nEscape URLs controllable from public brpc::WebEscape() escapes url to prevent injection attacks with malice.\nNot return addresses of internal servers Consider returning signatures of the addresses. For example after setting ServerOptions.internal_port, addresses in error information returned by server is replaced by their MD5 signatures.\nCustomize /health /health returns \u0026ldquo;OK\u0026rdquo; by default. If the content on /health needs to be customized: inherit HealthReporter and implement code to generate the page (like implementing other http services). Assign an instance to ServerOptions.health_reporter, which is not owned by server and must be valid during lifetime of the server. Users may return richer healthy information according to application requirements.\nthread-local variables Searching services inside Baidu use thread-local storage (TLS) extensively. Some of them cache frequently used objects to reduce repeated creations, some of them pass contexts to global functions implicitly. You should avoid the latter usage as much as possible. Such functions cannot even run without TLS, being hard to test. brpc provides 3 mechanisms to solve issues related to thread-local storage.\nsession-local A session-local data is bound to a server-side RPC: from entering CallMethod of the service, to calling the server-side done-\u0026gt;Run(), no matter the service is synchronous or asynchronous. All session-local data are reused as much as possible and not deleted before stopping the server.\nAfter setting ServerOptions.session_local_data_factory, call Controller.session_local_data() to get a session-local data. If ServerOptions.session_local_data_factory is unset, Controller.session_local_data() always returns NULL.\nIf ServerOptions.reserved_session_local_data is greater than 0, Server creates so many data before serving.\nExample\nstruct MySessionLocalData { MySessionLocalData() : x(123) {} int x; }; class EchoServiceImpl : public example::EchoService { public: ... void Echo(google::protobuf::RpcController* cntl_base, const example::EchoRequest* request, example::EchoResponse* response, google::protobuf::Closure* done) { ... brpc::Controller* cntl = static_cast\u0026lt;brpc::Controller*\u0026gt;(cntl_base); // Get the session-local data which is created by ServerOptions.session_local_data_factory // and reused between different RPC. MySessionLocalData* sd = static_cast\u0026lt;MySessionLocalData*\u0026gt;(cntl-\u0026gt;session_local_data()); if (sd == NULL) { cntl-\u0026gt;SetFailed(\u0026#34;Require ServerOptions.session_local_data_factory to be set with a correctly implemented instance\u0026#34;); return; } ... struct ServerOptions { ... // The factory to create/destroy data attached to each RPC session. // If this field is NULL, Controller::session_local_data() is always NULL. // NOT owned by Server and must be valid when Server is running. // Default: NULL const DataFactory* session_local_data_factory; // Prepare so many session-local data before server starts, so that calls // to Controller::session_local_data() get data directly rather than // calling session_local_data_factory-\u0026gt;Create() at first time. Useful when // Create() is slow, otherwise the RPC session may be blocked by the // creation of data and not served within timeout. // Default: 0 size_t reserved_session_local_data; }; session_local_data_factory is typed DataFactory. You have to implement CreateData and DestroyData inside.\nNOTE: CreateData and DestroyData may be called by multiple threads simultaneously. Thread-safety is a must.\nclass MySessionLocalDataFactory : public brpc::DataFactory { public: void* CreateData() const { return new MySessionLocalData; } void DestroyData(void* d) const { delete static_cast\u0026lt;MySessionLocalData*\u0026gt;(d); } }; MySessionLocalDataFactory g_session_local_data_factory; int main(int argc, char* argv[]) { ... brpc::Server server; brpc::ServerOptions options; ... options.session_local_data_factory = \u0026amp;g_session_local_data_factory; ... server-thread-local A server-thread-local is bound to a call to service\u0026rsquo;s CallMethod, from entering service\u0026rsquo;s CallMethod, to leaving the method. All server-thread-local data are reused as much as possible and will not be deleted before stopping the server. server-thread-local is implemented as a special bthread-local.\nAfter setting ServerOptions.thread_local_data_factory, call brpc::thread_local_data() to get a thread-local. If ServerOptions.thread_local_data_factory is unset, brpc::thread_local_data() always returns NULL.\nIf ServerOptions.reserved_thread_local_data is greater than 0, Server creates so many data before serving.\nDifferences with session-local\nsession-local data is got from server-side Controller, server-thread-local can be got globally from any function running directly or indirectly inside a thread created by the server.\nsession-local and server-thread-local are similar in a synchronous service, except that the former one has to be created from a Controller. If the service is asynchronous and the data needs to be accessed from done-\u0026gt;Run(), session-local is the only option, because server-thread-local is already invalid after leaving service\u0026rsquo;s CallMethod.\nExample\nstruct MyThreadLocalData { MyThreadLocalData() : y(0) {} int y; }; class EchoServiceImpl : public example::EchoService { public: ... void Echo(google::protobuf::RpcController* cntl_base, const example::EchoRequest* request, example::EchoResponse* response, google::protobuf::Closure* done) { ... brpc::Controller* cntl = static_cast\u0026lt;brpc::Controller*\u0026gt;(cntl_base); // Get the thread-local data which is created by ServerOptions.thread_local_data_factory // and reused between different threads. // \u0026#34;tls\u0026#34; is short for \u0026#34;thread local storage\u0026#34;.

You need to implement CreateData and DestroyData inside.\nNOTE: CreateData and DestroyData may be called by multiple threads simultaneously. Thread-safety is a must.\nclass MyThreadLocalDataFactory : public brpc::DataFactory { public: void* CreateData() const { return new MyThreadLocalData; } void DestroyData(void* d) const { delete static_cast\u0026lt;MyThreadLocalData*\u0026gt;(d); } }; MyThreadLocalDataFactory g_thread_local_data_factory; int main(int argc, char* argv[]) { ... brpc::Server server; brpc::ServerOptions options; ... options.thread_local_data_factory = \u0026amp;g_thread_local_data_factory; ... bthread-local Session-local and server-thread-local are enough for most servers. However, in some cases, we need a more general thread-local solution. In which case, you can use bthread_key_create, bthread_key_destroy, bthread_getspecific, bthread_setspecific etc, which are similar to pthread equivalence.\nThese functions support both bthread and pthread. When they are called in bthread, bthread private variables are returned; When they are called in pthread, pthread private variables are returned. Note that the \u0026ldquo;pthread private\u0026rdquo; here is not created by pthread_key_create, pthread-local created by pthread_key_create cannot be got by bthread_getspecific. __thread in GCC and thread_local in c++11 etc cannot be got by bthread_getspecific as well.\nSince brpc creates a bthread for each request, the bthread-local in the server behaves specially: a bthread created by server does not delete bthread-local data at exit, instead it returns the data to a pool in the server for later reuse. This prevents bthread-local from constructing and destructing frequently along with creation and destroying of bthreads. This mechanism is transparent to users.\nMain interfaces\n// Create a key value identifying a slot in a thread-specific data area. // Each thread maintains a distinct thread-specific data area. // `destructor\u0026#39;, if non-NULL, is called with the value associated to that key // when the key is destroyed. `destructor\u0026#39; is not called if the value // associated is NULL when the key is destroyed. // Returns 0 on success, error code otherwise. extern int bthread_key_create(bthread_key_t* key, void (*destructor)(void* data)); // Delete a key previously returned by bthread_key_create(). // It is the responsibility of the application to free the data related to // the deleted key in any running thread.

The // reason is that bthread-local always allocate keytable on first call to // bthread_setspecific, the overhead is negligible in long-lived threads, // but noticeable in shortly-lived threads.

FAQ Q: Fail to write into fd=1865 SocketId=8905@10.208.245.43:54742@8230: Got EOF A: The client-side probably uses pooled or short connections, and closes the connection after RPC timedout, when server writes back response, it finds that the connection has been closed and reports this error. \u0026ldquo;Got EOF\u0026rdquo; just means the server has received EOF (remote side closes the connection normally).

The implementation reduces cache bouncing by storing data in thread local storage(TLS), being much faster than UbMonitor(a legacy counting library inside Baidu) and even atomic operations in highly contended scenarios. brpc integrates bvar by default, namely all exposed bvars in a server are accessible through /vars, and a single bvar is addressable by /vars/VARNAME. Read vars to know how to query them in brpc servers. brpc extensively use bvar to expose internal status. If you are looking for an utility to collect and display metrics of your application, consider bvar in the first place. bvar definitely can\u0026rsquo;t replace all counters, essentially it moves contentions occurred during write to read: which needs to combine all data written by all threads and becomes much slower than an ordinary read. If read and write on the counter are both frequent or decisions need to be made based on latest values, you should not use bvar.\nTo understand how bvar works, read explaining cacheline first, in which the mentioned counter example is just bvar. When many threads are modifying a counter, each thread writes into its own area without joining the global contention and all private data are combined at read, which is much slower than an ordinary one, but OK for low-frequency logging or display. The much faster and very-little-overhead write enables users to monitor systems from all aspects without worrying about hurting performance. This is the purpose that we designed bvar.\nFollowing graph compares overhead of bvar, atomics, static UbMonitor, dynamic UbMonitor when they\u0026rsquo;re accessed by multiple threads simultaneously. We can see that overhead of bvar is not related to number of threads basically, and being constantly low (~20 nanoseconds). As a contrast, dynamic UbMonitor costs 7 microseconds on each operation when there\u0026rsquo;re 24 threads, which is the overhead of using the bvar for 300 times.\nAdding new bvar Read Quick introduction to know how to add bvar in C++. bvar already provides stats of many process-level and system-level variables by default, which are prefixed with process_ and system_, such as:\nprocess_context_switches_involuntary_second : 14 process_context_switches_voluntary_second : 15760 process_cpu_usage : 0.428 process_cpu_usage_system : 0.142 process_cpu_usage_user : 0.286 process_disk_read_bytes_second : 0 process_disk_write_bytes_second : 260902 process_faults_major : 256 process_faults_minor_second : 14 process_memory_resident : 392744960 system_core_count : 12 system_loadavg_15m : 0.040 system_loadavg_1m : 0.000 system_loadavg_5m : 0.020 and miscellaneous bvars used by brpc itself:\nbthread_switch_second : 20422 bthread_timer_scheduled_second : 4 bthread_timer_triggered_second : 4 bthread_timer_usage : 2.64987e-05 bthread_worker_count : 13 bthread_worker_usage : 1.33733 bvar_collector_dump_second : 0 bvar_collector_dump_thread_usage : 0.000307385 bvar_collector_grab_second : 0 bvar_collector_grab_thread_usage : 1.9699e-05 bvar_collector_pending_samples : 0 bvar_dump_interval : 10 bvar_revision : \u0026#34;34975\u0026#34; bvar_sampler_collector_usage : 0.00106495 iobuf_block_count : 89 iobuf_block_count_hit_tls_threshold : 0 iobuf_block_memory : 729088 iobuf_newbigview_second : 10 New exported files overwrite previous files, which is different from regular logs which append new data.\nMonitoring bvar Turn on dump feature of bvar to export all exposed bvars to files, which are formatted just like above texts: each line is a pair of \u0026ldquo;name\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;value\u0026rdquo;. Check if there\u0026rsquo;re data under $PWD/monitor/ after enabling dump, for example:\n$ ls monitor/ bvar.echo_client.data bvar.echo_server.data $ tail -5 monitor/bvar.echo_client.data process_swaps : 0 process_time_real : 2580.157680 process_time_system : 0.380942 process_time_user : 0.741887 process_username : \u0026#34;gejun\u0026#34; The monitoring system should combine data on every single machine periodically and merge them together to provide on-demand queries.

When the option -bvar_abort_on_same_name is true(false by default), program will abort.\nBest Practice for Naming: There are different bvar from different module, to avoid duplicating name, we\u0026rsquo;d better follow the rule as `module_class_indicator\na module usually refers to the program name, can be the acronym of product line, like inf_ds, ecom_retrbs etc. a class usually refers to the class name/ function name, like storage_manager, file_transfer, rank_stage1. an indicator usually refers to qps, count, latency etc. some legit naming examples iobuf_block_count : 29 # module=iobuf class=block indicator=count iobuf_block_memory : 237568 # module=iobuf class=block indicator=memory process_memory_resident : 34709504 # module=process class=memory indicator=resident process_memory_shared : 6844416 # module=process class=memory indicator=shared rpc_channel_connection_count : 0 # module=rpc class=channel_connection indicator=count rpc_controller_count : 1 # module=rpc class=controller indicator=count rpc_socket_count : 6 # module=rpc class=socket indicator=count bvar will normalize the variable name, no matter whether we type foo::BarNum, foo.bar.num, foo bar num , foo-bar-num, they all go to foo_bar_num in the end. Things about indicators:\nuse _count as suffix for number, like request_count, error_count use _second as suffix for number per second is clear enough, no need to use \u0026lsquo;_count_second\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;_per_second\u0026rsquo;, like request_second, process_inblocks_second _minute as suffix for number per minute like request_minute, process_inblocks_minute if we need to use a counter defined in another file, we have to declare that variable in header file namespace foo { namespace bar { // notice g_read_error_minute and g_task_pushed_second are derived bvar, will auto update, no need to declare extern bvar::Adder\u0026lt;int\u0026gt; g_read_error; extern bvar::LatencyRecorder g_write_latency; extern bvar::Adder\u0026lt;int\u0026gt; g_task_pushed; } // bar } // foo Don\u0026rsquo;t define golabel Window\u0026lt;\u0026gt; and PerSecond\u0026lt;\u0026gt; across files. The order for the initialization of global variables in different compile units is undefined. foo.cpp defines Adder\u0026lt;int\u0026gt; foo_count, then defining PerSecond\u0026lt;Adder\u0026lt;int\u0026gt; \u0026gt; foo_qps(\u0026amp;foo_count); in foo_qps.cpp is illegal Things about thread-safety:\nbvar is thread-compatible. We can manipulate a bvar in different threads, such as we can expose or hide different bvar in multiple threads simultaneously, they will safely do some job on global shared variables. Excpet read and write API, any other functions of bvar are not thread-safe：u can not expose or hide a same bvar in different threads, this may cause the program crash. Generally speaking, we don\u0026rsquo;t have to call any other API concurrently except read and write. we can use butil::Timer for timer, API is as below: #include \u0026lt;butil/time.h\u0026gt; namespace butil { class Timer { public: enum TimerType { STARTED }; Timer(); // butil::Timer tm(butil::Timer::STARTED); // tm is already started after creation. explicit Timer(TimerType); // Start this timer void start(); // Stop this timer void stop(); // Get the elapse from start() to stop(). int64_t n_elapsed() const; // in nanoseconds int64_t u_elapsed() const; // in microseconds int64_t m_elapsed() const; // in milliseconds int64_t s_elapsed() const; // in seconds }; } // namespace butil bvar::Variable: Varibale is the base class for all bvar, it provides registering, listing and searching functions.\nWhen user created a bvar with default params, it hasn\u0026rsquo;t been registered into any global structure, it\u0026rsquo;s merely a faster counter, which means we cannot use it elsewhere. The action of putting this bvar into the global registry is called expose, can be achieved by calling expose()\nThe name for globally exposed bvar consists of \u0026rsquo;name\u0026rsquo; or \u0026rsquo;name+prefix\u0026rsquo;, can be searched by function with suffix _exposed , e.g. Variable::describe_exposed(\u0026ldquo;foo\u0026rdquo;) will return the description of bvar with the name \u0026lsquo;foo\u0026rsquo;.\nWhen there already exists the name, expose() will print FATAL log and return -1. When the option -bvar_abort_on_same_name is true(false by default), program will abort.\nSome examples for expose() as below\nbvar::Adder\u0026lt;int\u0026gt; count1; // create a bvar with defalut params count1 \u0026lt;\u0026lt; 10 \u0026lt;\u0026lt; 20 \u0026lt;\u0026lt; 30; // values add up to 60. count1.expose(\u0026#34;count1\u0026#34;); // expose the variable globally CHECK_EQ(\u0026#34;60\u0026#34;, bvar::Variable::describe_exposed(\u0026#34;count1\u0026#34;)); count1.expose(\u0026#34;another_name_for_count1\u0026#34;); // expose the variable with another name CHECK_EQ(\u0026#34;\u0026#34;, bvar::Variable::describe_exposed(\u0026#34;count1\u0026#34;)); CHECK_EQ(\u0026#34;60\u0026#34;, bvar::Variable::describe_exposed(\u0026#34;another_name_for_count1\u0026#34;)); bvar::Adder\u0026lt;int\u0026gt; count2(\u0026#34;count2\u0026#34;); // exposed in constructor directly CHECK_EQ(\u0026#34;0\u0026#34;, bvar::Variable::describe_exposed(\u0026#34;count2\u0026#34;)); // default value of Adder\u0026lt;int\u0026gt; is 0 bvar::Status\u0026lt;std::string\u0026gt; status1(\u0026#34;count2\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;hello\u0026#34;); // the name conflicts. if -bvar_abort_on_same_name is true, // program aborts, otherwise a fatal log is printed. To avoid duplicate name, we should have prefix for bvar, we recommend the name as \u0026lt;namespace\u0026gt;_\u0026lt;module\u0026gt;_\u0026lt;name\u0026gt;\nFor convenience, we provide expose_as() as it will accept a prefix.\n// Expose this variable with a prefix. // Example: // namespace foo { // namespace bar { // class ApplePie { // ApplePie() { // // foo_bar_apple_pie_error // _error.expose_as(\u0026#34;foo_bar_apple_pie\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;error\u0026#34;); // } // private: // bvar::Adder\u0026lt;int\u0026gt; _error; // }; // } // foo // } // bar int expose_as(const butil::StringPiece\u0026amp; prefix, const butil::StringPiece\u0026amp; name); Export All Variables Common needs for exporting are querying by HTTP API and writing into local file, the former is provided by brpc /vars service, the latter has been implemented in bvar, and it\u0026rsquo;s turned off by default. A couple of methods can activate this function：\nUsing gflags to parse the input params. We can add -bvar_dump during the starup of program or we can dynamically change the params thru brpc /flags service after starup. gflags parsing is as below\n#include \u0026lt;gflags/gflags.h\u0026gt; ... int main(int argc, char* argv[]) { if (google::SetCommandLineOption(\u0026#34;bvar_dump\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;true\u0026#34;).empty()) { LOG(FATAL) \u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0026#34;Fail to enable bvar dump\u0026#34;; } ... } If u dont want to use gflags and expect them opened by default in program\n#include \u0026lt;gflags/gflags.h\u0026gt; ... int main(int argc, char* argv[]) { if (google::SetCommandLineOption(\u0026#34;bvar_dump\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;true\u0026#34;).empty()) { LOG(FATAL) \u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0026#34;Fail to enable bvar dump\u0026#34;; } ... } dump function is controlled by following gflags\nName Default Value Effect bvar_dump false Create a background thread dumping all bvar periodically, all bvar_dump_* flags are not effective when this flag is off bvar_dump_exclude \u0026quot;\u0026quot; Dump bvar excluded from these wildcards(separated by comma), empty means no exclusion bvar_dump_file monitor/bvar.\u0026lt;app\u0026gt;.data Dump bvar into this file bvar_dump_include \u0026quot;\u0026quot; Dump bvar matching these wildcards(separated by comma), empty means including all bvar_dump_interval 10 Seconds between consecutive dump bvar_dump_prefix \u0026lt;app\u0026gt; Every dumped name starts with this prefix bvar_dump_tabs \u0026lt;check the code\u0026gt; Dump bvar into different tabs according to the filters (seperated by semicolon), format: *(tab_name=wildcards) when the bvar_dump_file is not empty, a background thread will be started to update bvar_dump_file for the specified time interval called bvar_dump_interval , including all the bvar which is matched by bvar_dump_include while not matched by bvar_dump_exclude\nsuch like we modify the gflags as below：\nexporting file will be like：\n$ cat bvar.echo_server.data rpc_server_8002_builtin_service_count : 20 rpc_server_8002_connection_count : 1 rpc_server_8002_nshead_service_adaptor : brpc::policy::NovaServiceAdaptor rpc_server_8002_service_count : 1 rpc_server_8002_start_time : 2015/07/24-21:08:03 rpc_server_8002_uptime_ms : 14740954 iobuf_block_count : 8 is filtered out by bvar_dump_include, rpc_server_8002_error : 0 is ruled out by bvar_dump_exclude.\nif you didn\u0026rsquo;t use brpc in your program, u also need to dynamically change gflags（normally no need), we can call google::SetCommandLineOption(), as below\n#include \u0026lt;gflags/gflags.h\u0026gt; ... if (google::SetCommandLineOption(\u0026#34;bvar_dump_include\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;*service*\u0026#34;).empty()) { LOG(ERROR) \u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0026#34;Fail to set bvar_dump_include\u0026#34;; return -1; } LOG(INFO) \u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0026#34;Successfully set bvar_dump_include to *service*\u0026#34;; Do not directly set FLAGS_bvar_dump_file / FLAGS_bvar_dump_include / FLAGS_bvar_dump_exclude. On the one hand, these gflags are std::string, which are not thread-safe to be overridden；On the other hand, the validator will not be triggered(call back to check the correctness), so the exporting thread will not be invoked\nusers can also customize dump_exposed() to export all the exposed bvar：\n// Implement this class to write variables into different places. // If dump() returns false, Variable::dump_exposed() stops and returns -1. class Dumper { public: virtual bool dump(const std::string\u0026amp; name, const butil::StringPiece\u0026amp; description) = 0; }; // Options for Variable::dump_exposed(). struct DumpOptions { // Contructed with default options. DumpOptions(); // If this is true, string-type values will be quoted. bool quote_string; // The ? in wildcards. Wildcards in URL need to use another character // because ? is reserved. char question_mark; // Separator for white_wildcards and black_wildcards. char wildcard_separator; // Name matched by these wildcards (or exact names) are kept. std::string white_wildcards; // Name matched by these wildcards (or exact names) are skipped. std::string black_wildcards; }; class Variable { ... ... // Find all exposed variables matching `white_wildcards\u0026#39; but // `black_wildcards\u0026#39; and send them to `dumper\u0026#39;. // Use default options when `options\u0026#39; is NULL. // Return number of dumped variables, -1 on error. static int dump_exposed(Dumper* dumper, const DumpOptions* options); }; bvar::Reducer Reducer uses binary operators over several values to combine them into one final result, which are commutative, associative and without side effect. Only satisfying all of these thress, we can make sure the combined result is not affected by the distribution of the private variables of thread. Like substraciton does not satisfy associative nor commutative, so it cannot be taken as the operator here.\n// Reduce multiple values into one with `Op\u0026#39;: e1 Op e2 Op e3 ... // `Op\u0026#39; shall satisfy: // - associative: a Op (b Op c) == (a Op b) Op c // - commutative: a Op b == b Op a; // - no side effects: a Op b never changes if a and b are fixed. // otherwise the result is undefined. template \u0026lt;typename T, typename Op\u0026gt; class Reducer : public Variable; reducer \u0026laquo; e1 \u0026laquo; e2 \u0026laquo; e3 equals to reducer = e1 op e2 op e3。 Common Redcuer subclass: bvar::Adder, bvar::Maxer, bvar::Miner\nbvar::Adder we can tell from its name, it\u0026rsquo;s intended for running sum.

Some other non-time-related variables also fit in Window\u0026lt;\u0026gt;, such like calculating the CPU ratio over the last minute is using a Adder by summing CPU time and real time, then we use Window\u0026lt;\u0026gt; on top of the Adder to get the last-mintue CPU time and real time, dividing these two value then we get the CPU ratio for the last minute, which is not time-related. It will get wrong when use PerSeond\nbvar::Status Record and display one value, has additional set_value() function\n// Display a rarely or periodically updated value. // Usage: // bvar::Status\u0026lt;int\u0026gt; foo_count1(17); // foo_count1.expose(\u0026#34;my_value\u0026#34;); // // bvar::Status\u0026lt;int\u0026gt; foo_count2; // foo_count2.set_value(17); // // bvar::Status\u0026lt;int\u0026gt; foo_count3(\u0026#34;my_value\u0026#34;, 17); // // Notice that Tp needs to be std::string or acceptable by boost::atomic\u0026lt;Tp\u0026gt;. template \u0026lt;typename Tp\u0026gt; class Status : public Variable; bvar::PassiveStatus Display the value when needed.

It\u0026rsquo;s a non-contiguous zero-copied buffer, proved in previous projects, and good at performance. The interface of IOBuf is similar to std::string, but not the same.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;ve used the BufHandle in Kylin before, you should notice the convenience of IOBuf: the former one is badly encapsulated, leaving the internal structure directly in front of users, who must carefully handle the referential countings, very error prone and leading to bugs.\nWhat IOBuf can: Default constructor does not allocate memory. Copyable. Modifications to the copy doesn\u0026rsquo;t affect the original one. Copy the managing structure of IOBuf only rather the payload. Append another IOBuf without copying payload. Can append string, by copying payload. Read from or write into file descriptors. Serialize to or parse from protobuf messages. constructible like a std::ostream using IOBufBuilder.

It\u0026rsquo;s …","ref":"https://brpc.incubator.apache.org/docs/c++-base/iobuf/","title":"IOBuf"},{"body":"Multi-protocol support in the server side brpc server supports all protocols in the same port, and it makes deployment and maintenance more convenient in most of the time. Since the format of different protocols is very different, it is hard to support all protocols in the same port unambiguously. In consider of decoupling and extensibility, it is also hard to build a multiplexer for all protocols. Thus our way is to classify all protocols into three categories and try one by one:\nFirst-class protocol: Special characters are marked in front of the protocol data, for example, the data of protocol baidu_std and hulu_pbrpc begins with \u0026lsquo;PRPC\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;HULU\u0026rsquo; respectively. Parser just check first four characters to know whether the protocol is matched. This class of protocol is checked first and all these protocols can share one TCP connection. Second-class protocol: Some complex protocols without special marked characters can only be detected after several input data are parsed. Currently only HTTP is classified into this category. Third-class protocol: Special characters are in the middle of the protocol data, such as the magic number of nshead protocol is the 25th-28th characters. It is complex to handle this case because without reading first 28 bytes, we cannot determine whether the protocol is nshead. If it is tried before http, http messages less than 28 bytes may not be parsed, since the parser consider it as an incomplete nshead message. Considering that there will be only one protocol in most connections, we record the result of last selection so that it will be tried first when further data comes. It reduces the overhead of matching protocols to nearly zero for long connections. Although the process of matching protocols will be run every time for short connections, the bottleneck of short connections is not in here and this method is still fast enough. If there are lots of new protocols added into brpc in the future, we may consider some heuristic methods to match protocols.\nMulti-protocol support in the client side Unlike the server side that protocols must be dynamically determined based on the data on the connection, the client side as the originator, naturally know their own protocol format. As long as the protocol data is sent through connection pool or short connection, which means it has exclusive usage of that connection, then the protocol can have any complex (or bad) format. Since the client will record the protocol when sending the data, it will use that recorded protocol to parse the data without any matching overhead when responses come back. There is no magic number in some protocols like memcache, redis, it is hard to distinguish them in the server side, but it has no problem in the client side.\nSupport new protocols brpc is designed to add new protocols at any time, just proceed as follows:\nThe protocol that begins with nshead has unified support, just read this.\nadd ProtocolType Add new protocol type in ProtocolType in options.proto. If you need to add new protocol, please contact us to add it for you to make sure there is no conflict with protocols of others.\nCurrently we support in ProtocolType(at the middle of 2018):\nenum ProtocolType { PROTOCOL_UNKNOWN = 0; PROTOCOL_BAIDU_STD = 1; PROTOCOL_STREAMING_RPC = 2; PROTOCOL_HULU_PBRPC = 3; PROTOCOL_SOFA_PBRPC = 4; PROTOCOL_RTMP = 5; PROTOCOL_HTTP = 6; PROTOCOL_PUBLIC_PBRPC = 7; PROTOCOL_NOVA_PBRPC = 8; PROTOCOL_NSHEAD_CLIENT = 9; // implemented in brpc-ub PROTOCOL_NSHEAD = 10; PROTOCOL_HADOOP_RPC = 11; PROTOCOL_HADOOP_SERVER_RPC = 12; PROTOCOL_MONGO = 13; // server side only PROTOCOL_UBRPC_COMPACK = 14; PROTOCOL_DIDX_CLIENT = 15; // Client side only PROTOCOL_REDIS = 16; // Client side only PROTOCOL_MEMCACHE = 17; // Client side only PROTOCOL_ITP = 18; PROTOCOL_NSHEAD_MCPACK = 19; PROTOCOL_DISP_IDL = 20; // Client side only PROTOCOL_ERSDA_CLIENT = 21; // Client side only PROTOCOL_UBRPC_MCPACK2 = 22; // Client side only // Reserve special protocol for cds-agent, which depends on FIFO right now PROTOCOL_CDS_AGENT = 23; // Client side only PROTOCOL_ESP = 24; // Client side only PROTOCOL_THRIFT = 25; // Server side only } Implement Callbacks All callbacks are defined in struct Protocol, which is defined in protocol.h. Among all these callbacks, parse is a callback that must be implemented. Besides, process_request must be implemented in the server side and serialize_request, pack_request, process_response must be implemented in the client side.\nIt is difficult to implement callbacks of the protocol. These codes are not like the codes that ordinary users use which has good prompts and protections. You have to figure it out how to handle similar code in other protocols and implement your own protocol, then send it to us to do code review.\nparse typedef ParseResult (*Parse)(butil::IOBuf* source, Socket *socket, bool read_eof, const void *arg); This function is used to cut messages from source. Client side and server side must share the same parse function. The returned message will be passed to process_request(server side) or process_response(client side).\nArgument: source is the binary content from remote side, socket is the corresponding connection, read_eof is true iff the connection is closed by remote, arg is a pointer to the corresponding server in server client and NULL in client side.\nParseResult could be an error or a cut message, its possible value contains:\nPARSE_ERROR_TRY_OTHERS: current protocol is not matched, the framework would try next protocol. The data in source cannot be comsumed. PARSE_ERROR_NOT_ENOUGH_DATA: the input data hasn\u0026rsquo;t violated the current protocol yet, but the whole message cannot be detected as well. When there is new data from connection, new data will be appended to source and parse function is called again. If we can determine that data fits current protocol, the content of source can also be transferred to the internal state of protocol. For example, if source doesn\u0026rsquo;t contain a whole http message, it will be consumed by http parser to avoid repeated parsing. PARSE_ERROR_TOO_BIG_DATA: message size is too big, the connection will be closed to protect server. PARSE_ERROR_NO_RESOURCE: internal error, such as resource allocation failure. Connections will be closed. PARSE_ERROR_ABSOLUTELY_WRONG: it is supposed to be some protocols(magic number is matched), but the format is not as expected. Connection will be closed. serialize_request typedef bool (*SerializeRequest)(butil::IOBuf* request_buf, Controller* cntl, const google::protobuf::Message* request); This function is used to serialize request into request_buf that client must implement. It happens before a RPC call and will only be called once. Necessary information needed by some protocols(such as http) is contained in cntl. Return true if succeed, otherwise false.\npack_request typedef int (*PackRequest)(butil::IOBuf* msg, uint64_t correlation_id, const google::protobuf::MethodDescriptor* method, Controller* controller, const butil::IOBuf\u0026amp; request_buf, const Authenticator* auth); This function is used to pack request_buf into msg, which is called every time before sending messages to server(including retrying). When auth is not NULL, authentication information is also needed to be packed. Return 0 if succeed, otherwise -1.\nprocess_request typedef void (*ProcessRequest)(InputMessageBase* msg_base); This function is used to parse request messages in the server side that server must implement. It and parse() may run in different threads. Multiple process_request may run simultaneously. After the processing is done, msg_base-\u0026gt;Destroy() must be called. In order to prevent forgetting calling Destroy, consider using DestroyingPtr\u0026lt;\u0026gt;.\nprocess_response typedef void (*ProcessResponse)(InputMessageBase* msg); This function is used to parse message response in client side that client must implement. It and parse() may run in different threads. Multiple process_request may run simultaneously. After the processing is done, msg_base-\u0026gt;Destroy() must be called. In order to prevent forgetting calling Destroy, consider using DestroyingPtr\u0026lt;\u0026gt;.\nverify typedef bool (*Verify)(const InputMessageBase* msg); This function is used to authenticate connections, it is called when the first message is received. It is must be implemented by servers that need authentication, otherwise the function pointer can be NULL. Return true if succeed, otherwise false.\nparse_server_address typedef bool (*ParseServerAddress)(butil::EndPoint* out, const char* server_addr_and_port); This function converts server_addr_and_port(an argument of Channel.Init) to butil::EndPoint, which is optional. Some protocols may differ in the expression and understanding of server addresses.\nget_method_name typedef const std::string\u0026amp; (*GetMethodName)(const google::protobuf::MethodDescriptor* method, const Controller*); This function is used to customize method name, which is optional.\nsupported_connection_type Used to mark the supported connection method. If all connection methods are supported, this value should set to CONNECTION_TYPE_ALL. If connection pools and short connections are supported, this value should set to CONNECTION_TYPE_POOLED_AND_SHORT.\nname The name of the protocol, which appears in the various configurations and displays, should be as short as possible and must be a string constant.\nRegister to global RegisterProtocol should be called to register implemented protocol to brpc, just like:\nProtocol http_protocol = { ParseHttpMessage, SerializeHttpRequest, PackHttpRequest, ProcessHttpRequest, ProcessHttpResponse, VerifyHttpRequest, ParseHttpServerAddress, GetHttpMethodName, CONNECTION_TYPE_POOLED_AND_SHORT, \u0026#34;http\u0026#34; }; if (RegisterProtocol(PROTOCOL_HTTP, http_protocol) != 0) { exit(1); } ","excerpt":"Multi-protocol support in the server side brpc server supports all protocols in the same port, and …","ref":"https://brpc.incubator.apache.org/docs/rpc-in-depth/new-protocol/","title":"New Protocol"},{"body":"rpc_press无需写代码就压测各种rpc server，目前支持的协议有：\nbaidu_std hulu-pbrpc sofa-pbrpc public_pbrpc nova_pbrpc 获取工具 先按照Getting Started编译好brpc，再去tools/rpc_press编译。\n在CentOS 6.3上如果出现找不到libssl.so.4的错误，可执行ln -s /usr/lib64/libssl.so.6 libssl.so.4临时解决\n发压力 rpc_press会动态加载proto文件，无需把proto文件编译为c++源文件。rpc_press会加载json格式的输入文件，转为pb请求，发向server，收到pb回复后如有需要会转为json并写入用户指定的文件。\nrpc_press的所有的选项都来自命令行参数，而不是配置文件.\n如下的命令向下游0.0.0.0:8002用baidu_std重复发送两个pb请求，分别转自\u0026rsquo;{\u0026ldquo;message\u0026rdquo;:\u0026ldquo;hello\u0026rdquo;}和\u0026rsquo;{\u0026ldquo;message\u0026rdquo;:\u0026ldquo;world\u0026rdquo;}，持续压力直到按ctrl-c，qps为100。\njson也可以写在文件中，假如./input.json包含了上述两个请求，-input=./input.json也是可以的。\n必需参数：\n-proto：指定相关的proto文件名。 -method：指定方法名，形式必须是package.service.method。 -server：当-lb_policy为空时，是服务器的ip:port；当-lb_policy不为空时，是集群地址，比如bns://node-name, file://server_list等等。具体见命名服务。 -input: 指定json请求或包含json请求的文件。r32157后json间不需要分隔符，r32157前json间用分号分隔。 可选参数:\n-inc: 包含被import的proto文件的路径。rpc_press默认支持import目录下的其他proto文件，但如果proto文件在其他目录，就要通过这个参数指定，多个路径用分号(;)分隔。 -lb_policy: 指定负载均衡算法，默认为空，可选项为: rr random la c_murmurhash c_md5，具体见负载均衡。 -timeout_ms: 设定超时,单位是毫秒(milliseconds),默认是1000(1秒) -max_retry: 最大的重试次数,默认是3, 一般无需修改. brpc的重试行为具体请见这里. -protocol: 连接server使用的协议，可选项见协议, 默认是baidu_std -connection_type: 连接方式，可选项为: single pooled short，具体见连接方式。默认会根据协议自动选择,无需指定. -output: 如果不为空，response会转为json并写入这个文件，默认为空。 -duration：大于0时表示发送这么多秒的压力后退出，否则一直发直到按ctrl-c或进程被杀死。默认是0（一直发送）。 -qps：大于0时表示以这个压力发送，否则以最大速度(自适应)发送。默认是100。 -dummy_port：修改dummy_server的端口，默认是8888 常用的参数组合：\n向下游0.0.0.0:8002、用baidu_std重复发送./input.json中的所有请求，持续压力直到按ctrl-c，qps为100。 ./rpc_press -proto=echo.proto -method=example.EchoService.Echo -server=0.0.0.0:8002 -input=./input.json -qps=100 以round-robin分流算法向bns://node-name代表的所有下游机器、用baidu_std重复发送两个pb请求，持续压力直到按ctrl-c，qps为100。 ./rpc_press -proto=echo.proto -method=example.EchoService.Echo -server=bns://node-name -lb_policy=rr -input=\u0026rsquo;{\u0026ldquo;message\u0026rdquo;:\u0026ldquo;hello\u0026rdquo;} {\u0026ldquo;message\u0026rdquo;:\u0026ldquo;world\u0026rdquo;}\u0026rsquo; -qps=100 向下游0.0.0.0:8002、用hulu协议重复发送两个pb请求，持续压力直到按ctrl-c，qps为100。 ./rpc_press -proto=echo.proto -method=example.EchoService.Echo -server=0.0.0.0:8002 -protocol=hulu_pbrpc -input=\u0026rsquo;{\u0026ldquo;message\u0026rdquo;:\u0026ldquo;hello\u0026rdquo;} {\u0026ldquo;message\u0026rdquo;:\u0026ldquo;world\u0026rdquo;}\u0026rsquo; -qps=100 向下游0.0.0.0:8002、用baidu_std重复发送两个pb请求，持续最大压力直到按ctrl-c。 ./rpc_press -proto=echo.proto -method=example.EchoService.Echo -server=0.0.0.0:8002 -input=\u0026rsquo;{\u0026ldquo;message\u0026rdquo;:\u0026ldquo;hello\u0026rdquo;} {\u0026ldquo;message\u0026rdquo;:\u0026ldquo;world\u0026rdquo;}\u0026rsquo; -qps=0 向下游0.0.0.0:8002、用baidu_std重复发送两个pb请求，持续最大压力10秒钟。 ./rpc_press -proto=echo.proto -method=example.EchoService.Echo -server=0.0.0.0:8002 -input=\u0026rsquo;{\u0026ldquo;message\u0026rdquo;:\u0026ldquo;hello\u0026rdquo;} {\u0026ldquo;message\u0026rdquo;:\u0026ldquo;world\u0026rdquo;}\u0026rsquo; -qps=0 -duration=10 echo.proto中import了另一个目录下的proto文件 ./rpc_press -proto=echo.proto -inc= -method=example.EchoService.Echo -server=0.0.0.0:8002 -input=\u0026rsquo;{\u0026ldquo;message\u0026rdquo;:\u0026ldquo;hello\u0026rdquo;} {\u0026ldquo;message\u0026rdquo;:\u0026ldquo;world\u0026rdquo;}\u0026rsquo; -qps=0 -duration=10 rpc_press启动后会默认在8888端口启动一个dummy server，用于观察rpc_press本身的运行情况：\n./rpc_press -proto=echo.proto -service=example.EchoService -method=Echo -server=0.0.0.0:8002 -input=./input.json -duration=0 -qps=100 TRACE: 01-30 16:10:04: * 0 src/brpc/server.cpp:733] Server[dummy_servers] is serving on port=8888.

When the lock becomes a bottleneck, we try to walk around it by using atomic instructions. But it is difficult to write correct code with atomic instructions in generally and it is even hard to understand race conditions, ABA problems and memory fences. This article tries to introduce basics on atomic instructions(under SMP). Since Atomic instructions are formally introduced in C++11, we use the APIs directly.\nAs the name implies, atomic instructions cannot be divided into more sub-instructions. For example, x.fetch(n) atomically adds n to x, any internal state is not observable to software. Common atomic instructions are listed below:\nAtomic Instructions(type of x is std::atomic\u0026lt;int\u0026gt;) Descriptions x.load() return the value of x. x.store(n) store n to x and return nothing. x.exchange(n) set x to n and return the value just before the modification x.compare_exchange_strong(expected_ref, desired) If x is equal to expected_ref, set x to desired and return true. Otherwise write current x to expected_ref and return false. x.compare_exchange_weak(expected_ref, desired) may have spurious wakeup comparing to compare_exchange_strong x.fetch_add(n), x.fetch_sub(n) do x += n, x-= n atomically. Return the value just before the modification. You can already use these instructions to count something atomically, such as counting number of operations from multiple threads. However two problems may arise:\nThe operation is not as fast as expected. Even if multi-threaded accesses to some resources are controlled by a few atomic instructions that seem to be correct, the program still has great chance to crash. Cacheline An atomic instruction is fast when there\u0026rsquo;s no contentions or it\u0026rsquo;s accessed only by one thread. \u0026ldquo;Contentions\u0026rdquo; happen when multiple threads access the same cacheline. Modern CPU extensively use caches and divide caches into multiple levels to get high performance with a low price. The Intel E5-2620 widely used in Baidu has 32K L1 dcache and icache, 256K L2 cache and 15M L3 cache. L1 and L2 cache is owned by each core, while L3 cache is shared by all cores. Although it is very fast for one core to write data into its own L1 cache(4 cycles, ~2ns), make the data in L1 cache seen by other cores is not, because cachelines touched by the data need to be synchronized to other cores. This process is atomic and transparent to software and no instructions can be interleaved between. Applications have to wait for the completion of cache coherence, which takes much longer time than writing local cache. It involves a complicated hardware algorithm and makes atomic instructions slow under high contentions. A single fetch_add may take more than 700ns in E5-2620 when a few threads are highly contented on the instruction. Accesses to the memory frequently shared and modified by multiple threads are not fast generally. For example, even if a critical section looks small, the spinlock protecting it may still not perform well. The cause is that the instructions used in spinlock such as exchange, fetch_add etc, need to wait for latest cachelines. It\u0026rsquo;s not surprising to see that one or two instructions take several microseconds.\nIn order to improve performance, we need to avoid frequently synchronizing cachelines, which not only affects performance of the atomic instruction itself, but also overall performance of the program. The most effective solution is straightforward: avoid sharing as much as possible.\nA program relying on a global multiple-producer-multiple-consumer(MPMC) queue is hard to scale well on many CPU cores, because throughput of the queue is limited by delays of cache coherence, rather than number of cores. It would be better to use multiple SPMC or MPSC queues, or even SPSC queues instead, to avoid contentions from the very beginning. Another example is counters. If all threads modify a counter frequently, the performance will be poor because all cores are busy synchronizing the same cacheline. If the counter is only used for printing logs periodically or something low-priority like that, we can let each thread modify its own thread-local variables and combine all thread-local data before reading, yielding much better performance. A related programming trap is false sharing: Accesses to infrequently updated or even read-only variables are significantly slowed down because other variables in the same cacheline are frequently updated. Variables used in multi-threaded environment should be grouped by accessing frequencies or patterns, variables that are modified by that other threads frequently should be put into separated cachelines. To align a variable or struct by cacheline, include \u0026lt;butil/macros.h\u0026gt; and tag it with macro BAIDU_CACHELINE_ALIGNMENT, grep source code of brpc for examples.\nMemory fence Just atomic counting cannot synchronize accesses to resources, simple structures like spinlock or reference counting that seem correct may crash as well. The key is instruction reordering, which may change the order of read/write and cause instructions behind to be reordered to front if there are no dependencies. Compiler and CPU both may reorder.\nThe motivation is natural: CPU wants to fill each cycle with instructions and execute as many as possible instructions within given time. As said in above section, an instruction for loading memory may cost hundreds of nanoseconds due to cacheline synchronization. A efficient solution for synchronizing multiple cachelines is to move them simultaneously rather than one-by-one. Thus modifications to multiple variables by a thread may be visible to another thread in a different order. On the other hand, different threads need different data, synchronizing on-demand is reasonable and may also change order between cachelines.\nFor example: the first variable plays the role of switch, controlling accesses to following variables. When these variables are synchronized to other CPU cores, new values may be visible in a different order, and the first variable may not be the first updated, which causes other threads to think that the following variables are still valid, which are actually not, causing undefined behavior. Check code snippet below:\n// Thread 1 // ready was initialized to false p.init(); ready = true; // Thread2 if (ready) { p.bar(); } From a human perspective, the code is correct because thread2 only accesses p when ready is true which means p is initialized according to the logic in thread1. But the code may not run as expected on multi-core machines:\nready = true in thread1 may be reordered before p.init() by compiler or CPU, making thread2 see uninitialized p when ready is true. The same reordering may happen in thread2 as well. Some instructions in p.bar() may be reordered before checking ready. Even if above reorderings do not happen, cachelines of ready and p may be synchronized independently to the CPU core that thread2 runs, making thread2 see unitialized p when ready is true. Note: On x86/x64, load has acquire semantics and store has release semantics by default, the code above may run correctly provided that reordering by compiler is turned off.\nWith this simple example, you may get a glimpse of the complexity of atomic instructions. In order to solve the reordering issue, CPU and compiler offer memory fences to let programmers decide the visibility order between instructions. boost and C++11 conclude memory fence into following types:\nmemory order Description memory_order_relaxed there are no synchronization or ordering constraints imposed on other reads or writes, only this operation\u0026rsquo;s atomicity is guaranteed memory_order_consume no reads or writes in the current thread dependent on the value currently loaded can be reordered before this load. memory_order_acquire no reads or writes in the current thread can be reordered before this load. memory_order_release no reads or writes in the current thread can be reordered after this store. memory_order_acq_rel No memory reads or writes in the current thread can be reordered before or after this store. memory_order_seq_cst Any operation with this memory order is both an acquire operation and a release operation, plus a single total order exists in which all threads observe all modifications in the same order. Above example can be modified as follows:\n// Thread1 // ready was initialized to false p.init(); ready.store(true, std::memory_order_release); // Thread2 if (ready.load(std::memory_order_acquire)) { p.bar(); } The acquire fence in thread2 matches the release fence in thread1, making thread2 see all memory operations before the release fence in thread1 when thread2 sees ready being set to true.\nNote that memory fence does not guarantee visibility. Even if thread2 reads ready just after thread1 sets it to true, thread2 is not guaranteed to see the new value, because cache synchronization takes time. Memory fence guarantees ordering between visibilities: \u0026ldquo;If I see the new value of a, I should see the new value of b as well\u0026rdquo;.\nA related problem: How to know whether a value is updated or not? Two cases in generally:\nThe value is special. In above example, ready=true is a special value. Once ready is true, p is ready. Reading special values or not both mean something. Increasing-only values. Some situations do not have special values, we can use instructions like fetch_add to increase variables. As long as the value range is large enough, new values are different from old ones for a long period of time, so that we can distinguish them from each other. More examples can be found in boost.atomic. Official descriptions of atomics can be found here.\nwait-free \u0026amp; lock-free Atomic instructions provide two important properties: wait-free and lock-free. Wait-free means no matter how OS schedules, all threads are doing useful jobs; lock-free, which is weaker than wait-free, means no matter how OS schedules, at least one thread is doing useful jobs. If locks are used, the thread holding the lock might be paused by OS, in which case all threads trying to hold the lock are blocked. So code using locks are neither lock-free nor wait-free. To make tasks done within given time, critical paths in real-time OS is at least lock-free. Miscellaneous online services inside Baidu also pose serious restrictions on running time. If the critical path in brpc is wait-free or lock-free, many services are benefited from better and stable QoS. Actually, both read(in the sense of even dispatching) and write in brpc are wait-free, check IO for details.\nNote that it is common to think that wait-free or lock-free algorithms are faster, which may not be true, because:\nMore complex race conditions and ABA problems must be handled in lock-free and wait-free algorithms, which means the code is often much more complicated than the one using locks. More code, more running time. Mutex solves contentions by backoff, which means that when contention happens, another branch is entered to avoid the contention temporarily. Threads failed to lock a mutex are put into sleep, making the thread holding the mutex complete the task or even follow-up tasks exclusively, which may increase the overall throughput. Low performance caused by mutex is either because of too large critical sections (which limit the concurrency), or too heavy contentions (overhead of context switches becomes dominating). The real value of lock-free/wait-free algorithms is that they guarantee progress of the system, rather than absolutely high performance. Of course lock-free/wait-free algorithms perform better in some situations: if an algorithm is implemented by just one or two atomic instructions, it\u0026rsquo;s probably faster than the one using mutex which needs more atomic instructions in total.\n","excerpt":"We know that locks are extensively used in multi-threaded programming to avoid race conditions when …","ref":"https://brpc.incubator.apache.org/docs/rpc-in-depth/atomic-instructions/","title":"Atomic instructions"},{"body":"","excerpt":"","ref":"https://brpc.incubator.apache.org/docs/bthread/","title":"bthread"},{"body":"bthread是brpc使用的M:N线程库，目的是在提高程序的并发度的同时，降低编码难度，并在核数日益增多的CPU上提供更好的scalability和cache locality。”M:N“是指M个bthread会映射至N个pthread，一般M远大于N。由于linux当下的pthread实现(NPTL)是1:1的，M个bthread也相当于映射至N个LWP。bthread的前身是Distributed Process(DP)中的fiber，一个N:1的合作式线程库，等价于event-loop库，但写的是同步代码。\nGoals 用户可以延续同步的编程模式，能在数百纳秒内建立bthread，可以用多种原语同步。 bthread所有接口可在pthread中被调用并有合理的行为，使用bthread的代码可以在pthread中正常执行。 能充分利用多核。 better cache locality, supporting NUMA is a plus. NonGoals 提供pthread的兼容接口，只需链接即可使用。拒绝理由: bthread没有优先级，不适用于所有的场景，链接的方式容易使用户在不知情的情况下误用bthread，造成bug。 覆盖各类可能阻塞的glibc函数和系统调用，让原本阻塞系统线程的函数改为阻塞bthread。拒绝理由: bthread阻塞可能切换系统线程，依赖系统TLS的函数的行为未定义。 和阻塞pthread的函数混用时可能死锁。 这类hook函数本身的效率一般更差，因为往往还需要额外的系统调用，如epoll。但这类覆盖对N:1合作式线程库(fiber)有一定意义：虽然函数本身慢了，但若不覆盖会更慢（系统线程阻塞会导致所有fiber阻塞）。 修改内核让pthread支持同核快速切换。拒绝理由: 拥有大量pthread后，每个线程对资源的需求被稀释了，基于thread-local cache的代码效果会很差，比如tcmalloc。而独立的bthread不会有这个问题，因为它最终还是被映射到了少量的pthread。bthread相比pthread的性能提升很大一部分来自更集中的线程资源。另一个考量是可移植性，bthread更倾向于纯用户态代码。 FAQ Q：bthread是协程(coroutine)吗？ 不是。我们常说的协程特指N:1线程库，即所有的协程运行于一个系统线程中，计算能力和各类eventloop库等价。由于不跨线程，协程之间的切换不需要系统调用，可以非常快(100ns-200ns)，受cache一致性的影响也小。但代价是协程无法高效地利用多核，代码必须非阻塞，否则所有的协程都被卡住，对开发者要求苛刻。协程的这个特点使其适合写运行时间确定的IO服务器，典型如http server，在一些精心调试的场景中，可以达到非常高的吞吐。但百度内大部分在线服务的运行时间并不确定，且很多检索由几十人合作完成，一个缓慢的函数会卡住所有的协程。在这点上eventloop是类似的，一个回调卡住整个loop就卡住了，比如ubaserver（注意那个a，不是ubserver）是百度对异步框架的尝试，由多个并行的eventloop组成，真实表现糟糕：回调里打日志慢一些，访问redis卡顿，计算重一点，等待中的其他请求就会大量超时。所以这个框架从未流行起来。\nbthread是一个M:N线程库，一个bthread被卡住不会影响其他bthread。关键技术两点：work stealing调度和butex，前者让bthread更快地被调度到更多的核心上，后者让bthread和pthread可以相互等待和唤醒。这两点协程都不需要。更多线程的知识查看这里。\nQ: 我应该在程序中多使用bthread吗？ 不应该。除非你需要在一次RPC过程中让一些代码并发运行，你不应该直接调用bthread函数，把这些留给brpc做更好。\nQ：bthread和pthread worker如何对应？ pthread worker在任何时间只会运行一个bthread，当前bthread挂起时，pthread worker先尝试从本地runqueue弹出一个待运行的bthread，若没有，则随机偷另一个worker的待运行bthread，仍然没有才睡眠并会在有新的待运行bthread时被唤醒。\nQ：bthread中能调用阻塞的pthread或系统函数吗？ 可以，只阻塞当前pthread worker。其他pthread worker不受影响。\nQ：一个bthread阻塞会影响其他bthread吗？ 不影响。若bthread因bthread API而阻塞，它会把当前pthread worker让给其他bthread。若bthread因pthread API或系统函数而阻塞，当前pthread worker上待运行的bthread会被其他空闲的pthread worker偷过去运行。\nQ：pthread中可以调用bthread API吗？ 可以。bthread API在bthread中被调用时影响的是当前bthread，在pthread中被调用时影响的是当前pthread。使用bthread API的代码可以直接运行在pthread中。\nQ：若有大量的bthread调用了阻塞的pthread或系统函数，会影响RPC运行么？ 会。比如有8个pthread worker，当有8个bthread都调用了系统usleep()后，处理网络收发的RPC代码就暂时无法运行了。只要阻塞时间不太长, 这一般没什么影响, 毕竟worker都用完了, 除了排队也没有什么好方法. 在brpc中用户可以选择调大worker数来缓解问题, 在server端可设置ServerOptions.num_threads或-bthread_concurrency, 在client端可设置-bthread_concurrency.\n那有没有完全规避的方法呢?\n一个容易想到的方法是动态增加worker数. 但实际未必如意, 当大量的worker同时被阻塞时, 它们很可能在等待同一个资源(比如同一把锁), 增加worker可能只是增加了更多的等待者. 那区分io线程和worker线程? io线程专门处理收发, worker线程调用用户逻辑, 即使worker线程全部阻塞也不会影响io线程. 但增加一层处理环节(io线程)并不能缓解拥塞, 如果worker线程全部卡住, 程序仍然会卡住, 只是卡的地方从socket缓冲转移到了io线程和worker线程之间的消息队列. 换句话说, 在worker卡住时, 还在运行的io线程做的可能是无用功. 事实上, 这正是上面提到的没什么影响真正的含义. 另一个问题是每个请求都要从io线程跳转至worker线程, 增加了一次上下文切换, 在机器繁忙时, 切换都有一定概率无法被及时调度, 会导致更多的延时长尾. 一个实际的解决方法是限制最大并发, 只要同时被处理的请求数低于worker数, 自然可以规避掉\u0026quot;所有worker被阻塞\u0026quot;的情况. 另一个解决方法当被阻塞的worker超过阈值时(比如8个中的6个), 就不在原地调用用户代码了, 而是扔到一个独立的线程池中运行. 这样即使用户代码全部阻塞, 也总能保留几个worker处理rpc的收发. 不过目前bthread模式并没有这个机制, 但类似的机制在打开pthread模式时已经被实现了. 那像上面提到的, 这个机制是不是在用户代码都阻塞时也在做\u0026quot;无用功\u0026quot;呢? 可能是的. 但这个机制更多是为了规避在一些极端情况下的死锁, 比如所有的用户代码都lock在一个pthread mutex上, 并且这个mutex需要在某个RPC回调中unlock, 如果所有的worker都被阻塞, 那么就没有线程来处理RPC回调了, 整个程序就死锁了. 虽然绝大部分的RPC实现都有这个潜在问题, 但实际出现频率似乎很低, 只要养成不在锁内做RPC的好习惯, 这是完全可以规避的. Q：bthread会有Channel吗？ 不会。channel代表的是两点间的关系，而很多现实问题是多点的，这个时候使用channel最自然的解决方案就是：有一个角色负责操作某件事情或某个资源，其他线程都通过channel向这个角色发号施令。如果我们在程序中设置N个角色，让它们各司其职，那么程序就能分类有序地运转下去。所以使用channel的潜台词就是把程序划分为不同的角色。channel固然直观，但是有代价：额外的上下文切换。做成任何事情都得等到被调用处被调度，处理，回复，调用处才能继续。这个再怎么优化，再怎么尊重cache locality，也是有明显开销的。另外一个现实是：用channel的代码也不好写。由于业务一致性的限制，一些资源往往被绑定在一起，所以一个角色很可能身兼数职，但它做一件事情时便无法做另一件事情，而事情又有优先级。各种打断、跳出、继续形成的最终代码异常复杂。\n我们需要的往往是buffered channel，扮演的是队列和有序执行的作用，bthread提供了ExecutionQueue，可以完成这个目的。\n","excerpt":"bthread是brpc使用的M:N线程库，目的是在提高程序的并发度的同时，降低编码难度，并在核数日益增多的CPU上提供更好的scalability和cache locality。”M:N“是指M …","ref":"https://brpc.incubator.apache.org/docs/bthread/bthread/","title":"bthread"},{"body":"brpc提供了异步接口，所以一个常见的问题是：我应该用异步接口还是bthread？\n短回答：延时不高时你应该先用简单易懂的同步接口，不行的话用异步接口，只有在需要多核并行计算时才用bthread。\n同步或异步 异步即用回调代替阻塞，有阻塞的地方就有回调。虽然在javascript这种语言中回调工作的很好，接受度也非常高，但只要用过，就会发现这和我们需要的回调是两码事，这个区别不是lambda，也不是future，而是javascript是单线程的。javascript的回调放到多线程下可能没有一个能跑过，竞争太多，单线程的同步方法和多线程的同步方法是完全不同的。那是不是服务能搞成类似的形式呢？多个线程，每个都是独立的eventloop。可以，ubaserver就是（注意带a)，但实际效果糟糕，因为阻塞改回调可不简单，当阻塞发生在循环，条件分支，深层子函数中时，改造特别困难，况且很多老代码、第三方代码根本不可能去改造。结果是代码中会出现不可避免的阻塞，导致那个线程中其他回调都被延迟，流量超时，server性能不符合预期。如果你说，”我想把现在的同步代码改造为大量的回调，除了我其他人都看不太懂，并且性能可能更差了”，我猜大部分人不会同意。别被那些鼓吹异步的人迷惑了，他们写的是从头到尾从下到上全异步且不考虑多线程的代码，和你要写的完全是两码事。\nbrpc中的异步和单线程的异步是完全不同的，异步回调会运行在与调用处不同的线程中，你会获得多核扩展性，但代价是你得意识到多线程问题。你可以在回调中阻塞，只要线程够用，对server整体的性能并不会有什么影响。不过异步代码还是很难写的，所以我们提供了组合访问来简化问题，通过组合不同的channel，你可以声明式地执行复杂的访问，而不用太关心其中的细节。\n当然，延时不长，qps不高时，我们更建议使用同步接口，这也是创建bthread的动机：维持同步代码也能提升交互性能。\n判断使用同步或异步：计算qps * latency(in seconds)，如果和cpu核数是同一数量级，就用同步，否则用异步。\n比如：\nqps = 2000，latency = 10ms，计算结果 = 2000 * 0.01s = 20。和常见的32核在同一个数量级，用同步。 qps = 100, latency = 5s, 计算结果 = 100 * 5s = 500。和核数不在同一个数量级，用异步。 qps = 500, latency = 100ms，计算结果 = 500 * 0.1s = 50。基本在同一个数量级，可用同步。如果未来延时继续增长，考虑异步。 这个公式计算的是同时进行的平均请求数（你可以尝试证明一下），和线程数，cpu核数是可比的。当这个值远大于cpu核数时，说明大部分操作并不耗费cpu，而是让大量线程阻塞着，使用异步可以明显节省线程资源（栈占用的内存）。当这个值小于或和cpu核数差不多时，异步能节省的线程资源就很有限了，这时候简单易懂的同步代码更重要。\n异步或bthread 有了bthread这个工具，用户甚至可以自己实现异步。以“半同步”为例，在brpc中用户有多种选择：\n发起多个异步RPC后挨个Join，这个函数会阻塞直到RPC结束。（这儿是为了和bthread对比，实现中我们建议你使用ParallelChannel，而不是自己Join） 启动多个bthread各自执行同步RPC后挨个join bthreads。 哪种效率更高呢？显然是前者。后者不仅要付出创建bthread的代价，在RPC过程中bthread还被阻塞着，不能用于其他用途。\n如果仅仅是为了并发RPC，别用bthread。\n不过当你需要并行计算时，问题就不同了。使用bthread可以简单地构建树形的并行计算，充分利用多核资源。比如检索过程中有三个环节可以并行处理，你可以建立两个bthread运行两个环节，在原地运行剩下的环节，最后join那两个bthread。过程大致如下：\nbool search() { ... bthread th1, th2; if (bthread_start_background(\u0026amp;th1, NULL, part1, part1_args) != 0) { LOG(ERROR) \u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0026#34;Fail to create bthread for part1\u0026#34;; return false; } if (bthread_start_background(\u0026amp;th2, NULL, part2, part2_args) != 0) { LOG(ERROR) \u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0026#34;Fail to create bthread for part2\u0026#34;; return false; } part3(part3_args); bthread_join(th1); bthread_join(th2); return true; } 这么实现的point：\n你当然可以建立三个bthread分别执行三个部分，最后join它们，但相比这个方法要多耗费一个线程资源。 bthread从建立到执行是有延时的（调度延时），在不是很忙的机器上，这个延时的中位数在3微秒左右，90%在10微秒内，99.99%在30微秒内。这说明两点： 计算时间超过1ms时收益比较明显。如果计算非常简单，几微秒就结束了，用bthread是没有意义的。 尽量让原地运行的部分最慢，那样bthread中的部分即使被延迟了几微秒，最后可能还是会先结束，而消除掉延迟的影响。并且join一个已结束的bthread时会立刻返回，不会有上下文切换开销。 另外当你有类似线程池的需求时，像执行一类job的线程池时，也可以用bthread代替。如果对job的执行顺序有要求，你可以使用基于bthread的ExecutionQueue。\n","excerpt":"brpc提供了异步接口，所以一个常见的问题是：我应该用异步接口还是bthread？\n短回答：延时不高时你应该先用简单易懂的同步接口，不行的话用异步接口，只有在需要多核并行计算时才用bthread。\n同 …","ref":"https://brpc.incubator.apache.org/docs/bthread/bthread-or-not/","title":"bthread or not"},{"body":"brpc use brpc::Controller to set and get parameters for one RPC. Controller::ErrorCode() and Controller::ErrorText() return error code and description of the RPC respectively, only accessible after completion of the RPC, otherwise the result is undefined. ErrorText() is defined by the base class of the Controller: google::protobuf::RpcController, while ErrorCode() is defined by brpc::Controller. Controller also has a method Failed() to tell whether RPC fails or not. Relations between the three methods:\nWhen Failed() is true, ErrorCode() must be non-zero and ErrorText() be non-empty. When Failed() is false, ErrorCode() is 0 and ErrorText() is undefined (it\u0026rsquo;s empty in brpc currently, but you\u0026rsquo;d better not rely on this) Mark RPC as failed Both client and server in brpc have Controller, which can be set with setFailed() to modify ErrorCode and ErrorText. Multiple calls to Controller::SetFailed leave the last ErrorCode and concatenate ErrorTexts rather than leaving the last one. The framework elaborates ErrorTexts by adding extra prefixes: number of retries at client-side and address of the server at server-side.\nController::SetFailed() at client-side is usually called by the framework, such as sending failure, incomplete response, and so on. Error may be set at client-side under some situations. For example, you may set error to the RPC if an additional check before sending the request is failed.\nController::SetFailed() at server-side is often called by the user in the service callback. Generally speaking when error occurs, users call SetFailed(), release all the resources, and return from the callback. The framework fills the error code and message into the response according to communication protocol. When the response is received, the error inside are set into the client-side Controller so that users can fetch them after end of RPC. Note that server does not print errors to clients by default, as frequent loggings may impact performance of the server significantly due to heavy disk IO. A client crazily producing errors could slow the entire server down and affect all other clients, which can even become an attacking method against the server. If you really want to see error messages on the server, turn on the gflag -log_error_text (modifiable at run-time), the server will log the ErrorText of corresponding Controller of each failed RPC.\nError Code in brpc All error codes in brpc are defined in errno.proto, in which those begin with SYS_ are defined by linux system and exactly same with the ones defined in /usr/include/errno.h. The reason that we put it in .proto is to cross language. The rest of the error codes are defined by brpc.\nberror(error_code) gets description for the error code, and berror() gets description for current system errno.

Multi Producer: 多个线程可以同时向一个ExecutionQueue提交任务 支持cancel一个已经提交的任务 支持stop 支持高优任务插队 和ExecMan的主要区别:\nExecutionQueue的任务提交接口是wait-free的, ExecMan依赖了lock, 这意味着当机器整体比较繁忙的时候，使用ExecutionQueue不会因为某个进程被系统强制切换导致所有线程都被阻塞。 ExecutionQueue支持批量处理: 执行线程可以批量处理提交的任务, 获得更好的locality. ExecMan的某个线程处理完某个AsyncClient的AsyncContext之后下一个任务很可能是属于另外一个AsyncClient的AsyncContex, 这时候cpu cache会在不同AsyncClient依赖的资源间进行不停的切换。 ExecutionQueue的处理函数不会被绑定到固定的线程中执行, ExecMan中是根据AsyncClient hash到固定的执行线程，不同的ExecutionQueue之间的任务处理完全独立，当线程数足够多的情况下，所有非空闲的ExecutionQueue都能同时得到调度。同时也意味着当线程数不足的时候，ExecutionQueue无法保证公平性, 当发生这种情况的时候需要动态增加bthread的worker线程来增加整体的处理能力. ExecutionQueue运行线程为bthread, 可以随意的使用一些bthread同步原语而不用担心阻塞pthread的执行. 而在ExecMan里面得尽量避免使用较高概率会导致阻塞的同步原语. 背景 在多核并发编程领域， Message passing作为一种解决竞争的手段得到了比较广泛的应用，它按照业务依赖的资源将逻辑拆分成若干个独立actor，每个actor负责对应资源的维护工作，当一个流程需要修改某个资源的时候， 就转化为一个消息发送给对应actor，这个actor(通常在另外的上下文中)根据命令内容对这个资源进行相应的修改，之后可以选择唤醒调用者(同步)或者提交到下一个actor(异步)的方式进行后续处理。\nExecutionQueue Vs Mutex ExecutionQueue和mutex都可以用来在多线程场景中消除竞争. 相比较使用mutex, 使用ExecutionQueue有着如下几个优点:\n角色划分比较清晰, 概念理解上比较简单, 实现中无需考虑锁带来的问题(比如死锁) 能保证任务的执行顺序，mutex的唤醒顺序不能得到严格保证. 所有线程各司其职，都能在做有用的事情，不存在等待. 在繁忙、卡顿的情况下能更好的批量执行，整体上获得较高的吞吐. 但是缺点也同样明显:\n一个流程的代码往往散落在多个地方，代码理解和维护成本高。 为了提高并发度， 一件事情往往会被拆分到多个ExecutionQueue进行流水线处理，这样会导致在多核之间不停的进行切换，会付出额外的调度以及同步cache的开销, 尤其是竞争的临界区非常小的情况下， 这些开销不能忽略. 同时原子的操作多个资源实现会变得复杂, 使用mutex可以同时锁住多个mutex, 用了ExeuctionQueue就需要依赖额外的dispatch queue了。 由于所有操作都是单线程的，某个任务运行慢了就会阻塞同一个ExecutionQueue的其他操作。 并发控制变得复杂，ExecutionQueue可能会由于缓存的任务过多占用过多的内存。 不考虑性能和复杂度，理论上任何系统都可以只使用mutex或者ExecutionQueue来消除竞争. 但是复杂系统的设计上，建议根据不同的场景灵活决定如何使用这两个工具:\n如果临界区非常小，竞争又不是很激烈，优先选择使用mutex, 之后可以结合contention profiler来判断mutex是否成为瓶颈。 需要有序执行，或者无法消除的激烈竞争但是可以通过批量执行来提高吞吐， 可以选择使用ExecutionQueue。 总之，多线程编程没有万能的模型，需要根据具体的场景，结合丰富的profliling工具，最终在复杂度和性能之间找到合适的平衡。\n特别指出一点，Linux中mutex无竞争的lock/unlock只有需要几条原子指令，在绝大多数场景下的开销都可以忽略不计.\n使用方式 实现执行函数 // Iterate over the given tasks // // Example: // // #include \u0026lt;bthread/execution_queue.h\u0026gt; // // int demo_execute(void* meta, TaskIterator\u0026lt;T\u0026gt;\u0026amp; iter) { // if (iter.is_stopped()) { // // destroy meta and related resources // return 0; // } // for (; iter; ++iter) { // // do_something(meta, *iter) // // or do_something(meta, iter-\u0026gt;a_member_of_T) // } // return 0; // } template \u0026lt;typename T\u0026gt; class TaskIterator; 启动一个ExecutionQueue: // Start a ExecutionQueue. If |options| is NULL, the queue will be created with // default options. // Returns 0 on success, errno otherwise // NOTE: type |T| can be non-POD but must be copy-constructible template \u0026lt;typename T\u0026gt; int execution_queue_start( ExecutionQueueId\u0026lt;T\u0026gt;* id, const ExecutionQueueOptions* options, int (*execute)(void* meta, TaskIterator\u0026lt;T\u0026gt;\u0026amp; iter), void* meta); 创建的返回值是一个64位的id, 相当于ExecutionQueue实例的一个弱引用, 可以wait-free的在O(1)时间内定位一个ExecutionQueue, 你可以到处拷贝这个id， 甚至可以放在RPC中，作为远端资源的定位工具。 你必须保证meta的生命周期，在对应的ExecutionQueue真正停止前不会释放.\n停止一个ExecutionQueue: // Stop the ExecutionQueue. // After this function is called: // - All the following calls to execution_queue_execute would fail immediately. // - The executor will call |execute| with TaskIterator::is_queue_stopped() being // true exactly once when all the pending tasks have been executed, and after // this point it\u0026#39;s ok to release the resource referenced by |meta|. // Returns 0 on success, errno othrwise template \u0026lt;typename T\u0026gt; int execution_queue_stop(ExecutionQueueId\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; id); // Wait until the the stop task (Iterator::is_queue_stopped() returns true) has // been executed template \u0026lt;typename T\u0026gt; int execution_queue_join(ExecutionQueueId\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; id); stop和join都可以多次调用， 都会又合理的行为。stop可以随时调用而不用当心线程安全性问题。\n和fd的close类似，如果stop不被调用, 相应的资源会永久泄露。\n安全释放meta的时机: 可以在execute函数中收到iter.is_queue_stopped()==true的任务的时候释放，也可以等到join返回之后释放. 注意不要double-free\n提交任务 struct TaskOptions { TaskOptions(); TaskOptions(bool high_priority, bool in_place_if_possible); // Executor would execute high-priority tasks in the FIFO order but before // all pending normal-priority tasks. // NOTE: We don\u0026#39;t guarantee any kind of real-time as there might be tasks still // in process which are uninterruptible. // // Default: false bool high_priority;

h); 返回非0仅仅意味着ExecutionQueue已经将对应的task递给过execute, 真实的逻辑中可能将这个task缓存在另外的容器中，所以这并不意味着逻辑上的task已经结束，你需要在自己的业务上保证这一点.\n","excerpt":"概述 类似于kylin的ExecMan, ExecutionQueue提供了异步串行执行的功能。ExecutionQueue的相关技术最早使用在RPC中实现多线程向同一个fd写数据. 在r31345之 …","ref":"https://brpc.incubator.apache.org/docs/bthread/execution-queue/","title":"Execution Queue"},{"body":"r31658后，brpc能随机地把一部分请求写入一些文件中，并通过rpc_replay工具回放。目前支持的协议有：baidu_std, hulu_pbrpc, sofa_pbrpc。\n获取工具 先按照Getting Started编译好brpc，再去tools/rpc_replay编译。\n在CentOS 6.3上如果出现找不到libssl.so.4的错误，可执行ln -s /usr/lib64/libssl.so.6 libssl.so.4临时解决\n采样 brpc通过如下flags打开和控制如何保存请求，包含(R)后缀的flag都可以动态设置。\n参数说明：\n-rpc_dump是主开关，关闭时其他以rpc_dump开头的flag都无效。当打开-rpc_dump后，brpc会以一定概率采集请求，如果服务的qps很高，brpc会调节采样比例，使得每秒钟采样的请求个数不超过-bvar_collector_expected_per_second对应的值。这个值在目前同样影响rpcz和contention profiler，一般不用改动，以后会对不同的应用独立开来。 -rpc_dump_dir：设置存放被dump请求的目录 -rpc_dump_max_files: 设置目录下的最大文件数，当超过限制时，老文件会被删除以腾出空间。 -rpc_dump_max_requests_in_one_file：一个文件内的最大请求数，超过后写新文件。 brpc通过一个bvar::Collector来汇总来自不同线程的被采样请求，不同线程之间没有竞争，开销很小。\n写出的内容依次存放在rpc_dump_dir目录下的多个文件内，这个目录默认在./rpc_dump_，其中是程序名。不同程序在同一个目录下同时采样时会写入不同的目录。如果程序启动时rpc_dump_dir已经存在了，目录将被清空。目录中的每个文件以requests.yyyymmdd_hhmmss_uuuuus命名，以保证按时间有序方便查找，比如：\n目录下的文件数不超过rpc_dump_max_files，超过后最老的文件被删除从而给新文件腾出位置。\n文件是二进制格式，格式与baidu_std协议的二进制格式类似，每个请求的binary layout如下：\n\u0026#34;PRPC\u0026#34;

This requirement keeps all service declarations inside proto files rather than scattering in code, configurations, and proto files.\nExample http_server.cpp\nAbout h2 brpc names the HTTP/2 protocol to \u0026ldquo;h2\u0026rdquo;, no matter encrypted or not. However HTTP/2 connections without SSL are shown on /connections with the official name \u0026ldquo;h2c\u0026rdquo;, and the ones with SSL are shown as \u0026ldquo;h2\u0026rdquo;.\nThe APIs for http and h2 in brpc are basically same. Without explicit statement, mentioned http features work for h2 as well.\nURL types /ServiceName/MethodName as the prefix Define a service named ServiceName(not including the package name), with a method named MethodName and empty request/response, the service will provide http/h2 service on /ServiceName/MethodName by default.\nThe reason that request and response can be empty is that all data are in Controller:\nHeader of the http/h2 request is in Controller.http_request() and the body is in Controller.request_attachment(). Header of the http/h2 response is in Controller.http_response() and the body is in Controller.response_attachment(). Implementation steps:\nAdd the service declaration in a proto file. option cc_generic_services = true; message HttpRequest { }; message HttpResponse { }; service HttpService { rpc Echo(HttpRequest) returns (HttpResponse); }; Implement the service by inheriting the base class generated in .pb.h, which is same as protobuf services. class HttpServiceImpl : public HttpService { public: ... virtual void Echo(google::protobuf::RpcController* cntl_base, const HttpRequest* /*request*/, HttpResponse* /*response*/, google::protobuf::Closure* done) { brpc::ClosureGuard done_guard(done); brpc::Controller* cntl = static_cast\u0026lt;brpc::Controller*\u0026gt;(cntl_base); // body is plain text cntl-\u0026gt;http_response().set_content_type(\u0026#34;text/plain\u0026#34;); // Use printed query string and body as the response. butil::IOBufBuilder os; os \u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0026#34;queries:\u0026#34;; for (brpc::URI::QueryIterator it = cntl-\u0026gt;http_request().uri().QueryBegin(); it != cntl-\u0026gt;http_request().uri().QueryEnd(); ++it) { os \u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0026#39; \u0026#39; \u0026lt;\u0026lt; it-\u0026gt;first \u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0026#39;=\u0026#39; \u0026lt;\u0026lt; it-\u0026gt;second; } os \u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0026#34;\\nbody: \u0026#34; \u0026lt;\u0026lt; cntl-\u0026gt;request_attachment() \u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0026#39;\\n\u0026#39;; os.move_to(cntl-\u0026gt;response_attachment()); } }; After adding the implemented instance into the server, the service is accessible via following URLs (Note that the path after /HttpService/Echo is filled into cntl-\u0026gt;http_request().unresolved_path(), which is always normalized): URL Protobuf Method cntl-\u0026gt;http_request().uri().path() cntl-\u0026gt;http_request().unresolved_path() /HttpService/Echo HttpService.Echo \u0026ldquo;/HttpService/Echo\u0026rdquo; \u0026quot;\u0026quot; /HttpService/Echo/Foo HttpService.Echo \u0026ldquo;/HttpService/Echo/Foo\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Foo\u0026rdquo; /HttpService/Echo/Foo/Bar HttpService.Echo \u0026ldquo;/HttpService/Echo/Foo/Bar\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Foo/Bar\u0026rdquo; /HttpService//Echo///Foo// HttpService.Echo \u0026ldquo;/HttpService//Echo///Foo//\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Foo\u0026rdquo; /HttpService No such method /ServiceName as the prefix http/h2 services for managing resources may need this kind of URL, such as /FileService/foobar.txt represents ./foobar.txt and /FileService/app/data/boot.cfg represents ./app/data/boot.cfg.\nImplementation steps:\nUse FileService as the service name and default_method as the method name in the proto file. option cc_generic_services = true; message HttpRequest { }; message HttpResponse { }; service FileService { rpc default_method(HttpRequest) returns (HttpResponse); } Implement the service. class FileServiceImpl: public FileService { public: ... virtual void default_method(google::protobuf::RpcController* cntl_base, const HttpRequest* /*request*/, HttpResponse* /*response*/, google::protobuf::Closure* done) { brpc::ClosureGuard done_guard(done); brpc::Controller* cntl = static_cast\u0026lt;brpc::Controller*\u0026gt;(cntl_base); cntl-\u0026gt;response_attachment().append(\u0026#34;Getting file: \u0026#34;); cntl-\u0026gt;response_attachment().append(cntl-\u0026gt;http_request().unresolved_path()); } }; After adding the implemented instance into the server, the service is accessible via following URLs (the path after /FileService is filled in cntl-\u0026gt;http_request().unresolved_path(), which is always normalized): URL Protobuf Method cntl-\u0026gt;http_request().uri().path() cntl-\u0026gt;http_request().unresolved_path() /FileService FileService.default_method \u0026ldquo;/FileService\u0026rdquo; \u0026quot;\u0026quot; /FileService/123.txt FileService.default_method \u0026ldquo;/FileService/123.txt\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;123.txt\u0026rdquo; /FileService/mydir/123.txt FileService.default_method \u0026ldquo;/FileService/mydir/123.txt\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;mydir/123.txt\u0026rdquo; /FileService//mydir///123.txt// FileService.default_method \u0026ldquo;/FileService//mydir///123.txt//\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;mydir/123.txt\u0026rdquo; Restful URL brpc supports specifying a URL for each method in a service. The API is as follows:\n// If `restful_mappings\u0026#39; is non-empty, the method in service can // be accessed by the specified URL rather than /ServiceName/MethodName. // Mapping rules: \u0026#34;PATH1 =\u0026gt; NAME1, PATH2 =\u0026gt; NAME2 ...\u0026#34; // where `PATH\u0026#39; is a valid path and `NAME\u0026#39; is the method name. int AddService(google::protobuf::Service* service, ServiceOwnership ownership, butil::StringPiece restful_mappings); QueueService defined below contains several methods. If the service is added into the server normally, it\u0026rsquo;s accessible via URLs like /QueueService/start and /QueueService/stop.\nservice QueueService { rpc start(HttpRequest) returns (HttpResponse); rpc stop(HttpRequest) returns (HttpResponse); rpc get_stats(HttpRequest) returns (HttpResponse); rpc download_data(HttpRequest) returns (HttpResponse); }; By specifying the 3rd parameter restful_mappings to AddService, the URL can be customized:\nif (server.AddService(\u0026amp;queue_svc, brpc::SERVER_DOESNT_OWN_SERVICE, \u0026#34;/v1/queue/start =\u0026gt; start,\u0026#34; \u0026#34;/v1/queue/stop =\u0026gt; stop,\u0026#34; \u0026#34;/v1/queue/stats/* =\u0026gt; get_stats\u0026#34;) != 0) { LOG(ERROR) \u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0026#34;Fail to add queue_svc\u0026#34;; return -1; } if (server.AddService(\u0026amp;queue_svc, brpc::SERVER_DOESNT_OWN_SERVICE, \u0026#34;/v1/*/start =\u0026gt; start,\u0026#34; \u0026#34;/v1/*/stop =\u0026gt; stop,\u0026#34; \u0026#34;*.data =\u0026gt; download_data\u0026#34;) != 0) { LOG(ERROR) \u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0026#34;Fail to add queue_svc\u0026#34;; return -1; } There are 3 mappings separated by comma in the 3rd parameter (which is a string spanning 3 lines) to the AddService. Each mapping tells brpc to call the method at right side of the arrow if the left side matches the URL. The asterisk in /v1/queue/stats/* matches any string.\nMore about mapping rules:\nMultiple paths can be mapped to a same method. Both http/h2 and protobuf services are supported. Un-mapped methods are still accessible via /ServiceName/MethodName. Mapped methods are not accessible via /ServiceName/MethodName anymore. ==\u0026gt; and ===\u0026gt; are both OK, namely extra spaces at the beginning or the end, extra slashes, extra commas at the end, are all accepted. Pattern PATH and PATH/* can coexist. Support suffix matching: characters can appear after the asterisk. At most one asterisk is allowed in a path. The path after asterisk can be obtained by cntl.http_request().unresolved_path(), which is always normalized, namely no slashes at the beginning or the end, and no repeated slashes in the middle. For example:\nor:\nin which unresolved_path are both foo/bar. The extra slashes at the left, the right, or the middle are removed.\nNote that cntl.http_request().uri().path() is not ensured to be normalized, which is \u0026quot;//v1//queue//stats//foo///bar//////\u0026quot; and \u0026quot;//vars///foo////bar/////\u0026quot; respectively in the above example.\nThe built-in service page of /status shows customized URLs after the methods, in form of @URL1 @URL2 \u0026hellip;\nHTTP Parameters HTTP headers HTTP headers are a series of key/value pairs, some of them are defined by the HTTP specification, while others are free to use.\nQuery strings are also key/value pairs. Differences between HTTP headers and query strings:\nAlthough operations on HTTP headers are accurately defined by the http specification, but http headers cannot be modified directly from an address bar, they are often used for passing parameters of a protocol or framework. Query strings is part of the URL and often in form of key1=value1\u0026amp;key2=value2\u0026amp;..., which is easy to read and modify. They\u0026rsquo;re often used for passing application-level parameters. However format of query strings is not defined in HTTP spec, just a convention. // Get value for header \u0026#34;User-Agent\u0026#34; (case insensitive) const std::string* user_agent_str = cntl-\u0026gt;http_request().GetHeader(\u0026#34;User-Agent\u0026#34;); if (user_agent_str != NULL) { // has the header LOG(TRACE) \u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0026#34;User-Agent is \u0026#34; \u0026lt;\u0026lt; *user_agent_str; } ... // Add a header \u0026#34;Accept-encoding: gzip\u0026#34; (case insensitive) cntl-\u0026gt;http_response().SetHeader(\u0026#34;Accept-encoding\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;gzip\u0026#34;); // Overwrite the previous header \u0026#34;Accept-encoding: deflate\u0026#34; cntl-\u0026gt;http_response().SetHeader(\u0026#34;Accept-encoding\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;deflate\u0026#34;); // Append value to the previous header so that it becomes // \u0026#34;Accept-encoding: deflate,gzip\u0026#34; (values separated by comma) cntl-\u0026gt;http_response().AppendHeader(\u0026#34;Accept-encoding\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;gzip\u0026#34;); Content-Type Content-type is a frequently used header for storing type of the HTTP body, and specially processed in brpc and accessible by cntl-\u0026gt;http_request().content_type() . As a correspondence, cntl-\u0026gt;GetHeader(\u0026quot;Content-Type\u0026quot;) returns nothing.\n// Get Content-Type if (cntl-\u0026gt;http_request().content_type() == \u0026#34;application/json\u0026#34;) { ... } ... // Set Content-Type cntl-\u0026gt;http_response().set_content_type(\u0026#34;text/html\u0026#34;); If the RPC fails (Controller has been SetFailed), the framework overwrites Content-Type with text/plain and sets the response body with Controller::ErrorText().\nStatus Code Status code is a special field in HTTP response to store processing result of the http request. Possible values are defined in http_status_code.h.\n// Get Status Code if (cntl-\u0026gt;http_response().status_code() == brpc::HTTP_STATUS_NOT_FOUND) { LOG(FATAL) \u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0026#34;FAILED: \u0026#34; \u0026lt;\u0026lt; controller.http_response().reason_phrase(); } ... // Set Status code cntl-\u0026gt;http_response().set_status_code(brpc::HTTP_STATUS_INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR); cntl-\u0026gt;http_response().set_status_code(brpc::HTTP_STATUS_INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR, \u0026#34;My explanation of the error...\u0026#34;); For example, following code implements redirection with status code 302:\ncntl-\u0026gt;http_response().set_status_code(brpc::HTTP_STATUS_FOUND); cntl-\u0026gt;http_response().SetHeader(\u0026#34;Location\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;http://bj.bs.bae.baidu.com/family/image001(4979).jpg\u0026#34;); Query String As mentioned in above HTTP headers, query strings are interpreted in common convention, whose form is key1=value1\u0026amp;key2=value2\u0026amp;…. Keys without values are acceptable as well and accessible by GetQuery which returns an empty string. Such keys are often used as boolean flags. Full API are defined in uri.h.\nconst std::string* time_value = cntl-\u0026gt;http_request().uri().GetQuery(\u0026#34;time\u0026#34;); if (time_value != NULL) { // the query string is present LOG(TRACE) \u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0026#34;time = \u0026#34; \u0026lt;\u0026lt; *time_value; } ... cntl-\u0026gt;http_request().uri().SetQuery(\u0026#34;time\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;2015/1/2\u0026#34;); Debugging Turn on -http_verbose to print contents of all http requests and responses. Note that this should only be used for debugging rather than online services.\nCompress the response body HTTP services often compress http bodies to reduce transmission latency of web pages and speed up the presentations to end users.\nCall Controller::set_response_compress_type(brpc::COMPRESS_TYPE_GZIP) to try to compress the http body with gzip. \u0026ldquo;Try to\u0026rdquo; means the compression may not happen in following conditions:\nThe request does not set Accept-encoding or the value does not contain \u0026ldquo;gzip\u0026rdquo;. For example, curl does not support compression without option --compressed, in which case the server always returns uncompressed results.\nBody size is less than the bytes specified by -http_body_compress_threshold (512 by default). gzip is not a very fast compression algorithm. When the body is small, the delay added by compression may be larger than the time saved by network transmission. No compression when the body is relatively small is probably a better choice.\nName Value Description Defined At http_body_compress_threshold 512 Not compress http body when it\u0026rsquo;s less than so many bytes. src/brpc/policy/http_rpc_protocol.cpp Decompress the request body Due to generality, brpc does not decompress request bodies automatically, but users can do the job by themselves as follows:\n#include \u0026lt;brpc/policy/gzip_compress.h\u0026gt; ... const std::string* encoding = cntl-\u0026gt;http_request().GetHeader(\u0026#34;Content-Encoding\u0026#34;); if (encoding != NULL \u0026amp;\u0026amp; *encoding == \u0026#34;gzip\u0026#34;) { butil::IOBuf uncompressed; if (!brpc::policy::GzipDecompress(cntl-\u0026gt;request_attachment(), \u0026amp;uncompressed)) { LOG(ERROR) \u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0026#34;Fail to un-gzip request body\u0026#34;; return; } cntl-\u0026gt;request_attachment().swap(uncompressed); } // cntl-\u0026gt;request_attachment() contains the data after decompression Serve https requests https is short for \u0026ldquo;http over SSL\u0026rdquo;, SSL is not exclusive for http, but effective for all protocols. The generic method for turning on server-side SSL is here.\nPerformance Productions without extreme performance requirements tend to use HTTP protocol, especially mobile products. Thus we put great emphasis on implementation qualities of HTTP. To be more specific:\nUse http parser of node.js to parse http messages, which is a lightweight, well-written, and extensively used implementation. Use rapidjson to parse json, which is a json library focuses on performance. In the worst case, the time complexity of parsing http requests is still O(N), where N is byte size of the request. As a contrast, parsing code that requires the http request to be complete, may cost O(N^2) time in the worst case. This feature is very helpful since many HTTP requests are large. Processing HTTP messages from different clients is highly concurrent, even a pretty complicated http message does not block responding other clients. It\u0026rsquo;s difficult to achieve this for other RPC implementations and http servers often based on single-threaded reactor. Progressive sending brpc server is capable of sending large or infinite sized body, in following steps:\nCall Controller::CreateProgressiveAttachment() to create a body that can be written progressively. The returned ProgressiveAttachment object should be managed by intrusive_ptr #include \u0026lt;brpc/progressive_attachment.h\u0026gt; ... butil::intrusive_ptr\u0026lt;brpc::ProgressiveAttachment\u0026gt; pa = cntl-\u0026gt;CreateProgressiveAttachment(); Call ProgressiveAttachment::Write() to send the data.\nIf the write occurs before running of the server-side done, the sent data is cached until the done is called. If the write occurs after running of the server-side done, the sent data is written out in chunked mode immediately. After usage, destruct all butil::intrusive_ptr\u0026lt;brpc::ProgressiveAttachment\u0026gt; to release related resources.\nProgressive receiving Currently brpc server doesn\u0026rsquo;t support calling the service callback once header part in the http request is parsed. In other words, brpc server is not suitable for receiving large or infinite sized body.\nFAQ Q: The nginx before brpc encounters final fail The error is caused by that brpc server closes the http connection directly without sending a response.\nbrpc server supports a variety of protocols on the same port. When a request is failed to be parsed in HTTP, it\u0026rsquo;s hard to tell that the request is definitely in HTTP. If the request is very likely to be one, the server sends HTTP 400 errors and closes the connection. However, if the error is caused HTTP method(at the beginning) or ill-formed serialization (may be caused by bugs at the HTTP client), the server still closes the connection without sending a response, which leads to \u0026ldquo;final fail\u0026rdquo; at nginx.\nSolution: When using Nginx to forward traffic, set $HTTP_method to allowed HTTP methods or simply specify the HTTP method in proxy_method.\nQ: Does brpc support http chunked mode Yes.\nQ: Why do HTTP requests containing BASE64 encoded query string fail to parse sometimes? According to the HTTP specification, following characters need to be encoded with %.\nreserved = gen-delims / sub-delims gen-delims = \u0026#34;:\u0026#34; / \u0026#34;/\u0026#34; / \u0026#34;?\u0026#34; / \u0026#34;#\u0026#34; / \u0026#34;[\u0026#34; / \u0026#34;]\u0026#34; / \u0026#34;@\u0026#34; sub-delims = \u0026#34;!\u0026#34; / \u0026#34;$\u0026#34; / \u0026#34;\u0026amp;\u0026#34; / \u0026#34;\u0026#39;\u0026#34; / \u0026#34;(\u0026#34; / \u0026#34;)\u0026#34; / \u0026#34;*\u0026#34; / \u0026#34;+\u0026#34; / \u0026#34;,\u0026#34; / \u0026#34;;\u0026#34; / \u0026#34;=\u0026#34; Base64 encoded string may end with = which is a reserved character (take ?wi=NDgwMDB8dGVzdA==\u0026amp;anothorkey=anothervalue as an example). The strings may be parsed successfully, or may be not, depending on the implementation which should not be assumed in principle.\nOne solution is to remove the trailing = which does not affect the Base64 decoding. Another method is to percent-encode the URI, and do percent-decoding before Base64 decoding.\n","excerpt":"This document talks about ordinary htt/h2 services rather than protobuf services accessible via …","ref":"https://brpc.incubator.apache.org/docs/server/serve-httph2/","title":"Serve http:h2"},{"body":"/status shows primary statistics of services inside the server.

As a contrast, failing to access back-end servers during the processing is an error of the service, not a non_service_error.

As most objects are complicate, user needs to convert all the fields to string first in order to use printf with %s. However it\u0026rsquo;s very inconvenient (can\u0026rsquo;t append numbers) and needs lots of temporary memory (caused by string). The solution in C++ is to send the log as a stream to the std::ostream object. For example, in order to print object A, we need to implement the following interface:\nstd::ostream\u0026amp; operator\u0026lt;\u0026lt;(std::ostream\u0026amp; os, const A\u0026amp; a); The signature of the function means to print object a to os and then return os. The return value of os enables us to combine binary operator \u0026lt;\u0026lt; (left-combine). As a result, os \u0026lt;\u0026lt; a \u0026lt;\u0026lt; b \u0026lt;\u0026lt; c; means operator\u0026lt;\u0026lt;(operator\u0026lt;\u0026lt;(operator\u0026lt;\u0026lt;(os, a), b), c);. Apparently operator\u0026lt;\u0026lt; needs a returning reference to complete this process, which is also called chaining. In languages that don\u0026rsquo;t support operator overloading, you will see a more tedious form, such as os.print(a).print(b).print(c).\nYou should also use chaining in your own implementation of operator\u0026lt;\u0026lt;. In fact, printing a complex object is like DFS a tree: Call operator\u0026lt;\u0026lt; on each child node, and then each child node invokes the function on the grandchild node, and so forth. For example, object A has two member variables: B and C. Printing A becomes the process of putting B and C ostream:\nstruct A { B b; C c; }; std::ostream\u0026amp; operator\u0026lt;\u0026lt;(std::ostream\u0026amp; os, const A\u0026amp; a) { return os \u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0026#34;A{b=\u0026#34; \u0026lt;\u0026lt; a.b \u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0026#34;, c=\u0026#34; \u0026lt;\u0026lt; a.c \u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0026#34;}\u0026#34;; } Data structure of B and C along with the print function：\nstruct B { int value; }; std::ostream\u0026amp; operator\u0026lt;\u0026lt;(std::ostream\u0026amp; os, const B\u0026amp; b) { return os \u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0026#34;B{value=\u0026#34; \u0026lt;\u0026lt; b.value \u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0026#34;}\u0026#34;; } struct C { string name; }; std::ostream\u0026amp; operator\u0026lt;\u0026lt;(std::ostream\u0026amp; os, const C\u0026amp; c) { return os \u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0026#34;C{name=\u0026#34; \u0026lt;\u0026lt; c.name \u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0026#34;}\u0026#34;; } Finally the result of printing object A is:\nA{b=B{value=10}, c=C{name=tom}} This way we don\u0026rsquo;t need to allocate temporary memory since objects are directly passed into the ostream object. Of course, the memory management of ostream itself is another topic.\nOK, now we connect the whole printing process by ostream. The most common ostream objects are std::cout and std::cerr, so objects implement the above function can be directly sent to std::cout and std::cerr. In other words, if a log stream also inherits ostream, then these objects can be written into log. Streaming log is such a log stream that inherits std::ostream to send the object into the log. In the current implementation, the logs are recorded in a thread-local buffer, which will be flushed into screen or logging::LogSink after a complete log record. Of course, the implementation is thread safe.\nLOG If you have ever used glog before, you should find it easy to start. The log macro is the same as glog. For example, to print a FATAL log (Note that there is no std::endl):\nLOG(FATAL) \u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0026#34;Fatal error occurred! contexts=\u0026#34; \u0026lt;\u0026lt; ...; LOG(WARNING) \u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0026#34;Unusual thing happened ...\u0026#34; \u0026lt;\u0026lt; ...; LOG(TRACE) \u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0026#34;Something just took place...\u0026#34; \u0026lt;\u0026lt; ...; The log level of streaming log in accordance with glog：\nstreaming log glog Use Cases FATAL FATAL (coredump) Fatal error. Since most fatal log inside baidu is not fatal actually, it won\u0026rsquo;t trigger coredump directly as glog, unless you turn on -crash_on_fatal_log ERROR ERROR Non-fatal error. WARNING WARNING Unusual branches NOTICE - Generally you should not use NOTICE as it\u0026rsquo;s intended for important business logs. Make sure to check with other developers. glog doesn\u0026rsquo;t have NOTICE. INFO, TRACE INFO Important side effects such as open/close some resources. VLOG(n) INFO Detailed log that support multiple layers. DEBUG INFOVLOG(1) (NDEBUG) Just for compatibility. Print logs only when NDEBUG is not defined. See DLOG/DPLOG/DVLOG for more reference. PLOG The difference of PLOG and LOG is that it will append error information at the end of log. It\u0026rsquo;s kind of like %m in printf. Under POSIX environment, the error code is errno。\nint fd = open(\u0026#34;foo.conf\u0026#34;, O_RDONLY); // foo.conf does not exist, errno was set to ENOENT if (fd \u0026lt; 0) { PLOG(FATAL) \u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0026#34;Fail to open foo.conf\u0026#34;; // \u0026#34;Fail to open foo.conf: No such file or directory\u0026#34; return -1; } noflush If you don\u0026rsquo;t want to flush the log at once, append noflush. It\u0026rsquo;s commonly used inside a loop:\nLOG(TRACE) \u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0026#34;Items:\u0026#34; \u0026lt;\u0026lt; noflush; for (iterator it = items.begin(); it != items.end(); ++it) { LOG(TRACE) \u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0026#39; \u0026#39; \u0026lt;\u0026lt; *it \u0026lt;\u0026lt; noflush; } LOG(TRACE); The first two LOG(TRACE) doesn\u0026rsquo;t flush the log to the screen. They are recorded inside the thread-local buffer. The third LOG(TRACE) flush all logs into the screen. If there are 3 elements inside items and we don\u0026rsquo;t append noflush, the result would be:\nTRACE: ... Items: TRACE: ... item1 TRACE: ... item2 TRACE: ... item3 After we add noflush:\nTRACE: ... Items: item1 item2 item3 The noflush feature also support bthread so that we can push lots of logs from the server\u0026rsquo;s bthreads without actually print them (using noflush), and flush the whole log at the end of RPC. Note that you should not use noflush when implementing an asynchronous method since it will change the underlying bthread, leaving noflush out of function.\nLOG_IF LOG_IF(log_level, condition) prints only when condition is true. It\u0026rsquo;s the same as if (condition) { LOG() \u0026lt;\u0026lt; ...; } with shorter code：\nLOG_IF(NOTICE, n \u0026gt; 10) \u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0026#34;This log will only be printed when n \u0026gt; 10\u0026#34;; XXX_EVERY_SECOND XXX represents for LOG, LOG_IF, PLOG, SYSLOG, VLOG, DLOG, and so on. These logging macros print log at most once per second. You can use these to check running status inside hotspot area. The first call to this macro prints the log immediately, and costs additional 30ns (caused by gettimeofday) compared to normal LOG.\nLOG_EVERY_SECOND(INFO) \u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0026#34;High-frequent logs\u0026#34;; XXX_EVERY_N XXX represents for LOG, LOG_IF, PLOG, SYSLOG, VLOG, DLOG, and so on. These logging macros print log every N times. You can use these to check running status inside hotspot area. The first call to this macro prints the log immediately, and costs an additional atomic operation (relaxed order) compared to normal LOG. This macro is thread safe which means counting from multiple threads is also accurate while glog is not.\nLOG_EVERY_N(ERROR, 10) \u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0026#34;High-frequent logs\u0026#34;; XXX_FIRST_N XXX represents for LOG, LOG_IF, PLOG, SYSLOG, VLOG, DLOG, and so on. These logging macros print log at most N times. It costs an additional atomic operation (relaxed order) compared to normal LOG before N, and zero cost after.\nLOG_FIRST_N(ERROR, 20) \u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0026#34;Logs that prints for at most 20 times\u0026#34;; XXX_ONCE XX represents for LOG, LOG_IF, PLOG, SYSLOG, VLOG, DLOG, and so on. These logging macros print log at most once. It\u0026rsquo;s the same as XXX_FIRST_N(..., 1)\nLOG_ONCE(ERROR) \u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0026#34;Logs that only prints once\u0026#34;; VLOG VLOG(verbose_level) is detail log that support multiple layers. It uses 2 gflags: \u0026ndash;verbose and \u0026ndash;verbose_module to control the logging layer you want (Note that glog uses \u0026ndash;v and \u0026ndash;vmodule). The log will be printed only when --verbose \u0026gt;= verbose_level:\nVLOG(0) \u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0026#34;verbose log tier 0\u0026#34;; VLOG(1) \u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0026#34;verbose log tier 1\u0026#34;; VLOG(2) \u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0026#34;verbose log tier 2\u0026#34;; When --verbose=1, the first 2 log will be printed while the last won\u0026rsquo;t. Module means a file or file path without the extension name, and value of --verbose_module will overwrite --verbose. For example:\n--verbose=1 --verbose_module=\u0026#34;channel=2,server=3\u0026#34; # print VLOG of those with verbose value: # channel.cpp \u0026lt;= 2 # server.cpp \u0026lt;= 3 # other files \u0026lt;= 1 --verbose=1 --verbose_module=\u0026#34;src/brpc/channel=2,server=3\u0026#34; # For files with same names, add paths You can set --verbose and --verbose_module through google::SetCommandLineOption dynamically.\nVLOG has another form VLOG2, which allows user to specify virtual path:\n// public/foo/bar.cpp VLOG2(\u0026#34;a/b/c\u0026#34;, 2) \u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0026#34;being filtered by a/b/c rather than public/foo/bar\u0026#34;; VLOG and VLOG2 also have corresponding VLOG_IF and VLOG2_IF.\nDLOG All log macros have debug versions, starting with D, such as DLOG, DVLOG. When NDEBUG is defined, these logs will not be printed.\nDo not put important side effects inside the log streams beginning with D.\nNo printing means that even the parameters are not evaluated. If your parameters have side effects, they won\u0026rsquo;t happend when NDEBUG is defined. For example, DLOG(FATAL) \u0026lt;\u0026lt; foo(); where foo is a function or it changes a dictionary, anyway, it\u0026rsquo;s essential. However, it won\u0026rsquo;t be evaluated when NDEBUG is defined.\nCHECK Another import variation of logging is CHECK(expression). When expression evaluates to false, it will print a fatal log. It\u0026rsquo;s kind of like ASSERT in gtest, and has other form such as CHECK_EQ, CHECK_GT, and so on. When check fails, the message after will be printed.\nCHECK_LT(1, 2) \u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0026#34;This is definitely true, this log will never be seen\u0026#34;; CHECK_GT(1, 2) \u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0026#34;1 can\u0026#39;t be greater than 2\u0026#34;; Run the above code you should see a fatal log and the calling stack：\nFATAL: ...

CHECK(x \u0026gt; y); // Check failed: x \u0026gt; y. Like DLOG, you should NOT include important side effects inside DCHECK.\nLogSink The default destination of streaming log is the screen. You can change it through logging::SetLogSink. Users can inherit LogSink and implement their own output logic. We provide an internal LogSink as an example:\nStringSink Inherit both LogSink and string. Store log content inside string and mainly aim for unit test. The following case shows a classic usage of StringSink:\nTEST_F(StreamingLogTest, log_at) { ::logging::StringSink log_str; ::logging::LogSink* old_sink = ::logging::SetLogSink(\u0026amp;log_str); LOG_AT(FATAL, \u0026#34;specified_file.cc\u0026#34;, 12345) \u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0026#34;file/line is specified\u0026#34;; // the file:line part should be using the argument given by us.

SomeObject* p = \u0026amp;obj; p-\u0026gt;bar(); bthread_usleep(1000); p-\u0026gt;bar(); bthread_usleep之后，该bthread很可能身处不同的pthread，这时p指向了之前pthread的thread_local变量，继续访问p的结果无法预计。这种使用模式往往发生在用户使用线程级变量传递业务变量的情况。为了防止这种情况，应该谨记：\n不使用线程级变量传递业务数据。这是一种槽糕的设计模式，依赖线程级数据的函数也难以单测。判断是否滥用：如果不使用线程级变量，业务逻辑是否还能正常运行？线程级变量应只用作优化手段，使用过程中不应直接或间接调用任何可能阻塞的bthread函数。比如使用线程级变量的tcmalloc就不会和bthread有任何冲突。 如果一定要（在业务中）使用线程级变量，使用bthread_key_create和bthread_getspecific。 gcc4下的errno问题 gcc4会优化标记为__attribute__((const))的函数，这个标记大致指只要参数不变，输出就不会变。所以当一个函数中以相同参数出现多次时，gcc4会合并为一次。比如在我们的系统中errno是内容为*__errno_location()的宏，这个函数的签名是：\n/* Function to get address of global `errno\u0026#39; variable. */ extern int *__errno_location (void) __THROW __attribute__ ((__const__)); 由于此函数被标记为__const__，且没有参数，当你在一个函数中调用多次errno时，可能只有第一次才调用__errno_location()，而之后只是访问其返回的int*。在pthread中这没有问题，因为返回的int*是thread-local的，一个给定的pthread中是不会变化的。但是在bthread中，这是不成立的，因为一个bthread很可能在调用一些函数后跑到另一个pthread去，如果gcc4做了类似的优化，即一个函数内所有的errno都替换为第一次调用返回的int*，这中间bthread又切换了pthread，那么可能会访问之前pthread的errno，从而造成未定义行为。\n比如下文是一种errno的使用场景：\nUse errno ... (original pthread) bthread functions that may switch to another pthread. Use errno ... (another pthread) 我们期望看到的行为：\nUse *__errno_location() ... - the thread-local errno of original pthread bthread may switch another pthread ... Use *__errno_location() ... - the thread-local errno of another pthread 使用gcc4时的实际行为：\nint* p= __errno_location(); Use *p ... - the thread-local errno of original pthread bthread context switches ... Use *p ... - still the errno of original pthread, undefined behavior!! 严格地说这个问题不是gcc4导致的，而是glibc给__errno_location的签名不够准确，一个返回thread-local指针的函数依赖于段寄存器（TLS的一般实现方式），这怎么能算const呢？由于我们还未找到覆盖__errno_location的方法，所以这个问题目前实际的解决方法是：\n务必在直接或间接使用bthread的项目的gcc编译选项中添加-D__const__=，即把__const__定义为空，避免gcc4做相关优化。\n把__const__定义为空对程序其他部分的影响几乎为0。另外如果你没有直接使用errno（即你的项目中没有出现errno），或使用的是gcc 3.4，即使没有定义-D__const__=，程序的正确性也不会受影响，但为了防止未来可能的问题，我们强烈建议加上。\n需要说明的是，和errno类似，pthread_self也有类似的问题，不过一般pthread_self除了打日志没有其他用途，影响面较小，在-D__const__=后pthread_self也会正常。\n","excerpt":"本页说明bthread下使用pthread-local可能会导致的问题。bthread-local的使用方法见这里。\nthread-local问题 调用阻塞的bthread函数后，所在的pthread …","ref":"https://brpc.incubator.apache.org/docs/bthread/thread-local/","title":"thread-local"},{"body":"背景 baidu-dsp是联盟基于Ad Exchange和RTB模式的需求方平台，服务大客户、代理的投放产品体系。我们改造了多个模块，均取得了显著的效果。本文只介绍其中关于super-nova-as的改动。super-nova-as是的baidu-dsp的AS，之前使用ub-aserver编写，为了尽量减少改动，我们没有改造整个as，而只是把super-nova-as连接下游（ctr-server、cvr-server、super-nova-bs）的client从ubrpc升级为brpc。\n结论 as的吞吐量有显著提升（不到1500 -\u0026gt; 2500+） cpu优化：从1500qps 50%cpu_idle提高到2000qps 50% cpu_idle； 超时率改善明显。 测试过程 环境：1个as，1个bs，1个ctr，1个cvr；部署情况为：bs单机部署，as+ctr+cvr混布；ctr和cvr为brpc版本 分别采用1000,1500压力对ubrpc版本的as进行压测，发现1500压力下，as对bs有大量的超时，as到达瓶颈； 分别采用2000,2500压力对brpc版本的as进行压测，发现2500压力下，as机器的cpu_idle低于30%，as到达瓶颈。brpc对资源利用充分。 ubrpc brpc 流量 bs成功率 cpu_idle ctr成功率 cvr成功率 ","excerpt":"背景 baidu-dsp是联盟基于Ad Exchange和RTB模式的需求方平台，服务大客户、代理的投放产品体系。我们改造了多个模块，均取得了显著的效果。本文只介绍其中关于super-nova-as的 …","ref":"https://brpc.incubator.apache.org/docs/use-cases-inside-baidu/use-case2/","title":"联盟DSP"},{"body":"","excerpt":"","ref":"https://brpc.incubator.apache.org/docs/client/","title":"Client"},{"body":"With the growth of services, access patterns to downstream servers become increasingly complicated and often contain multiple RPCs in parallel or layered accesses. The complications could easily introduce tricky bugs around multi-threaded programming, which may even not be sensed by users and difficult to debug and reproduce. Moreover, implementations either support synchronous patterns only, or have totally different code for asynchronous patterns. Take running some code after completions of multiple asynchronous RPCs as an example, the synchronous pattern is often implemented as issuing multiple RPCs asynchronously and waiting for the completions respectively, while the asynchronous pattern is often implemented by a callback plus a referential count, which is decreased by one when one RPC completes. The callback is called when the count hits zero. Let\u0026rsquo;s see drawbacks of the solution:\nThe code is inconsistent between synchronous and asynchronous pattern and it\u0026rsquo;s not trivial for users to move from one pattern to another. From the designing point of view, inconsistencies implies that the essence is probably not grasped yet. Cancellation is unlikely to be supported. It\u0026rsquo;s not easy to cancel a single RPC correctly, let alone combinations of RPC. However cancellations are necessary to end pointless waiting in many scenarios. Not composable. It\u0026rsquo;s hard to enclose the implementations above as one part of a \u0026ldquo;larger\u0026rdquo; pattern. The code can hardly be reused in a different scenario. We need a better abstraction. If several channels are combined into a larger one with different access patterns enclosed, users would be able to do synchronous, asynchronous, cancelling operations with consistent and unified interfaces. The kind of channels are called combo channels in brpc.\nParallelChannel ParallelChannel (referred to as \u0026ldquo;pchan\u0026rdquo; sometimes) sends requests to all internal sub channels in parallel and merges the responses. Users can modify requests via CallMapper and merge responses with ResponseMerger. ParallelChannel looks like a Channel:\nSupport synchronous and asynchronous accesses. Can be destroyed immediately after initiating an asynchronous operation. Support cancellation. Support timeout. Check example/parallel_echo_c++ for an example.\nAny subclasses of brpc::ChannelBase can be added into ParallelChannel, including ParallelChannel and other combo channels. Set ParallelChannelOptions.fail_limit to control maximum number of failures. When number of failed responses reaches the limit, the RPC is ended immediately rather than waiting for timeout.\nA sub channel can be added to the same ParallelChannel more than once, which is useful when you need to initiate multiple asynchronous RPC to the same service and wait for their completions.\nFollowing picture shows internal structure of ParallelChannel (Chinese in red: can be different from request/response respectively)\nAdd sub channel A sub channel can be added into ParallelChannel by following API:\nint AddChannel(brpc::ChannelBase* sub_channel, ChannelOwnership ownership, CallMapper* call_mapper, ResponseMerger* response_merger); When ownership is brpc::OWNS_CHANNEL, sub_channel is destroyed when the ParallelChannel destructs. Although a sub channel may be added into a ParallelChannel multiple times, it\u0026rsquo;s deleted for at most once when ownership in one of the additions is brpc::OWNS_CHANNEL.\nCalling AddChannel during a RPC over ParallelChannel is NOT thread safe.\nCallMapper This class converts RPCs to ParallelChannel to the ones to sub channel. If call_mapper is NULL, requests to the sub channel is just the ones to ParallelChannel, and responses are created by calling New() on the responses to ParallelChannel. call_mapper is deleted when ParallelChannel destructs. Due to the reference counting inside, one call_mapper can be associated with multiple sub channels.\nclass CallMapper { public: virtual ~CallMapper(); virtual SubCall Map(int channel_index/*starting from 0*/, const google::protobuf::MethodDescriptor* method, const google::protobuf::Message* request, google::protobuf::Message* response) = 0; }; channel_index: The position of the sub channel inside ParallelChannel, starting from zero.\nmethod/request/response: Parameters to ParallelChannel::CallMethod().\nThe returned SubCall configures the calls to the corresponding sub channel and has two special values:\nSubCall::Bad(): The call to ParallelChannel fails immediately and Controller::ErrorCode() is set to EREQUEST. SubCall::Skip(): Skip the call to this sub channel. If all sub channels are skipped, the call to ParallelChannel fails immediately and Controller::ErrorCode() is set to ECANCELED. Common implementations of Map() are listed below:\nBroadcast the request. This is also the behavior when call_mapper is NULL: class Broadcaster : public CallMapper { public: SubCall Map(int channel_index/*starting from 0*/, const google::protobuf::MethodDescriptor* method, const google::protobuf::Message* request, google::protobuf::Message* response) { // Use the method/request to pchan. // response is created by `new` and the last flag tells pchan to delete response after completion of the RPC return SubCall(method, request, response-\u0026gt;New(), DELETE_RESPONSE); } }; Modify some fields in the request before sending: class ModifyRequest : public CallMapper { public: SubCall Map(int channel_index/*starting from 0*/, const google::protobuf::MethodDescriptor* method, const google::protobuf::Message* request, google::protobuf::Message* response) { FooRequest* copied_req = brpc::Clone\u0026lt;FooRequest\u0026gt;(request); copied_req-\u0026gt;set_xxx(...); // Copy and modify the request // The last flag tells pchan to delete the request and response after completion of the RPC return SubCall(method, copied_req, response-\u0026gt;New(), DELETE_REQUEST | DELETE_RESPONSE); } }; request/response already contains sub requests/responses, use them directly. class UseFieldAsSubRequest : public CallMapper { public: SubCall Map(int channel_index/*starting from 0*/, const google::protobuf::MethodDescriptor* method, const google::protobuf::Message* request, google::protobuf::Message* response) { if (channel_index \u0026gt;= request-\u0026gt;sub_request_size()) { // Not enough sub_request. The caller doesn\u0026#39;t provide same number of requests as number of sub channels in pchan // Return Bad() to end this RPC immediately return SubCall::Bad(); } // Fetch the sub request and add a new sub response. // The last flag(0) tells pchan that there is nothing to delete. return SubCall(sub_method, request-\u0026gt;sub_request(channel_index), response-\u0026gt;add_sub_response(), 0); } }; ResponseMerger response_merger merges responses from all sub channels into one for the ParallelChannel. When it\u0026rsquo;s NULL, response-\u0026gt;MergeFrom(*sub_response) is used instead, whose behavior can be summarized as \u0026ldquo;merge repeated fields and overwrite the rest\u0026rdquo;. If you need more complex behavior, implement ResponseMerger. Multiple response_merger are called one by one to merge sub responses so that you do not need to consider the race conditions between merging multiple responses simultaneously. The object is deleted when ParallelChannel destructs. Due to the reference counting inside, response_merger can be associated with multiple sub channels.\nPossible values of Result are:\nMERGED: Successfully merged. FAIL: The sub_response was not merged successfully, counted as one failure. For example, there are 10 sub channels and fail_limit is 4, if 4 merges return FAIL, the RPC would reach fail_limit and end soon. FAIL_ALL: Directly fail the RPC. Get the controller to each sub channel Sometimes users may need to know the details around sub calls. Controller.sub(i) gets the controller corresponding to a sub channel.\n// Get the controllers for accessing sub channels in combo channels. // Ordinary channel: // sub_count() is 0 and sub() is always NULL. // ParallelChannel/PartitionChannel: // sub_count() is #sub-channels and sub(i) is the controller for // accessing i-th sub channel inside ParallelChannel, if i is outside // [0, sub_count() - 1], sub(i) is NULL. // NOTE: You must test sub() against NULL, ALWAYS. Even if i is inside // range, sub(i) can still be NULL: // * the rpc call may fail and terminate before accessing the sub channel // * the sub channel was skipped // SelectiveChannel/DynamicPartitionChannel: // sub_count() is always 1 and sub(0) is the controller of successful // or last call to sub channels. int sub_count() const; const Controller* sub(int index) const; SelectiveChannel SelectiveChannel (referred to as \u0026ldquo;schan\u0026rdquo; sometimes) accesses one of the internal sub channels with a load balancing algorithm. It\u0026rsquo;s more high-level compared to ordinary channels: The requests are sent to sub channels instead of servers directly. SelectiveChannel is mainly for load balancing between groups of machines and shares basic properties of Channel:\nSupport synchronous and asynchronous accesses. Can be destroyed immediately after initiating an asynchronous operation. Support cancellation. Support timeout. Check example/selective_echo_c++ for an example.\nAny subclasses of brpc::ChannelBase can be added into SelectiveChannel, including SelectiveChannel and other combo channels.\nRetries done by SelectiveChannel are independent from the ones in its sub channels. When a call to one of the sub channels fails(which may have been retried), other sub channels are retried.\nCurrently SelectiveChannel requires the request remains valid before completion of the RPC, while other combo or regular channels do not. If you plan to use SelectiveChannel asynchronously, make sure that the request is deleted inside done.\nUsing SelectiveChannel The initialization of SelectiveChannel is almost the same as regular Channel, except that it doesn\u0026rsquo;t need a naming service in Init, because SelectiveChannel adds sub channels dynamically by AddChannel, while regular Channel adds servers in the naming service.\n#include \u0026lt;brpc/selective_channel.h\u0026gt; ... brpc::SelectiveChannel schan; brpc::ChannelOptions schan_options; schan_options.timeout_ms = ...; schan_options.backup_request_ms = ...; schan_options.max_retry = ...; if (schan.Init(load_balancer, \u0026amp;schan_options) != 0) { LOG(ERROR) \u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0026#34;Fail to init SelectiveChannel\u0026#34;; return -1; } After successful initialization, add sub channels with AddChannel.\n// The second parameter ChannelHandle is used to delete sub channel, // which can be NULL if this isn\u0026#39;t necessary. if (schan.AddChannel(sub_channel, NULL/*ChannelHandle*/) != 0) { LOG(ERROR) \u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0026#34;Fail to add sub_channel\u0026#34;; return -1; } Note that:\nUnlike ParallelChannel, SelectiveChannel::AddChannel can be called at any time, even if a RPC over the SelectiveChannel is going on. (newly added channels take effects at the next RPC). SelectiveChannel always owns sub channels, which is different from ParallelChannel\u0026rsquo;s configurable ownership. If the second parameter to AddChannel is not NULL, it\u0026rsquo;s filled with a value typed brpc::SelectiveChannel::ChannelHandle, which can be used as the parameter to RemoveAndDestroyChannel to remove and destroy a channel dynamically. SelectiveChannel overrides timeouts in sub channels. For example, having timeout set to 100ms for a sub channel and 500ms for SelectiveChannel, the actual timeout is 500ms. SelectiveChannels are accessed same as regular channels.\nExample: divide traffic to multiple naming services Sometimes we need to divide traffic to multiple naming services, because:\nMachines for one service are listed in multiple naming services. Machines are split into multiple groups. Requests are sent to one of the groups and then routed to one of the machines inside the group, and traffic are divided differently between groups and machines in a group. Above requirements can be achieved by SelectiveChannel.\nFollowing code creates a SelectiveChannel and inserts 3 regular channels for different naming services respectively.\nbrpc::SelectiveChannel channel; brpc::ChannelOptions schan_options; schan_options.timeout_ms = FLAGS_timeout_ms; schan_options.max_retry = FLAGS_max_retry; if (channel.Init(\u0026#34;c_murmurhash\u0026#34;, \u0026amp;schan_options) != 0) { LOG(ERROR) \u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0026#34;Fail to init SelectiveChannel\u0026#34;; return -1; } for (int i = 0; i \u0026lt; 3; ++i) { brpc::Channel* sub_channel = new brpc::Channel; if (sub_channel-\u0026gt;Init(ns_node_name[i], \u0026#34;rr\u0026#34;, NULL) != 0) { LOG(ERROR) \u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0026#34;Fail to init sub channel \u0026#34; \u0026lt;\u0026lt; i; return -1; } if (channel.AddChannel(sub_channel, NULL/*handle for removal*/) != 0) { LOG(ERROR) \u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0026#34;Fail to add sub_channel to channel\u0026#34;; return -1; } } ... XXXService_Stub stub(\u0026amp;channel); stub.FooMethod(\u0026amp;cntl, \u0026amp;request, \u0026amp;response, NULL); ... PartitionChannel PartitionChannel is a specialized ParallelChannel to add sub channels automatically based on tags defined in the naming service. As a result, users can list all machines in one naming service and partition them by tags. Check example/partition_echo_c++ for an example.\nParititonChannel only supports one kind to partitioning method. When multiple methods need to coexist, or one method needs to be changed to another smoothly, try DynamicPartitionChannel, which creates corresponding sub PartitionChannel for different partitioning methods, and divide traffic to partitions according to capacities of servers. Check example/dynamic_partition_echo_c++ for an example.\nIf partitions are listed in different naming services, users have to implement the partitioning by ParallelChannel and include sub channels to corresponding naming services respectively. Refer to the previous section for usages of ParellelChannel.\nUsing PartitionChannel First of all, implement your own PartitionParser.

Capacity of a server is 1 by default if the naming services does not configure weights. The capacity of ParallelChannel or PartitionChannel is the minimum of all its sub channel\u0026rsquo;s.

FlatMap可能是最快的哈希表，但当value较大时它需要更多的内存，它最适合作为检索过程中需要极快查找的小字典。\n原理：把开链桶中第一个节点的内容直接放桶内。由于在实践中，大部分桶没有冲突或冲突较少，所以大部分操作只需要一次内存跳转：通过哈希值访问对应的桶。桶内两个及以上元素仍存放在链表中，由于桶之间彼此独立，一个桶的冲突不会影响其他桶，性能很稳定。在很多时候，FlatMap的查找性能和原生数组接近。\nBENCHMARK 下面是FlatMap和其他key/value容器的比较：\nAlignHashMap：闭链中较快的实现。 CowHashMap：smalltable中的开链哈希表，和普通开链不同的是带Copy-on-write逻辑。 std::map：非哈希表，一般是红黑树。 TRACE: 12-30 13:19:53: * 0 [test_flat_map.cpp:474] [ value = 8 bytes

9/14/20/169ns Overview of hashmaps 哈希表是最常用的数据结构，它的基本原理是通过计算哈希值把不同的key分散到不同的区间，在查找时通过key的哈希值能快速地缩小查找区间。在使用恰当参数的前提下，哈希表在大部分时候能在O(1)时间内把一个key映射为value。像其他算法一样，这个“O(1)”在不同的实现中差异很大。哈希表的实现一般有两部分：\n计算哈希值(非加密型) 即把key散列开的方法，最常见的莫过于线性同余，但一个好的哈希算法(非加密型)要考虑很多因素：\n结果是确定的。 雪崩效应：输入中一个bit的变化应该尽量影响输出所有bit的变化。 输出应尽量在值域中均匀分布。 充分利用现代cpu特性：成块计算，减少分支，循环展开等等。 大部分哈希算法针对的只是一个key，不会耗用太多的cpu。影响主要来自哈希表的整体数据分布，对于工程师来说，选用何种算法得看实践效果，一些最简单的方法也许就有很好的效果。通用算法可选择Murmurhash。\n解决冲突 哈希值可能重合，解决冲突是哈希表性能的另一关键因素。常见的冲突解决方法有：\n开链哈希(open hashing, closed addressing): 开链哈希表是链表的数组，其中链表一般称为桶。当若干个key落到同一个桶时，做链表插入。这是最通用的结构，有很多优点：占用内存为O(NumElement * (KeySize + ValueSize + SomePointers))，resize时候不会使之前的存放key/value的内存失效。桶之间是独立的，一个桶的冲突不会影响到其他桶，平均查找时间较为稳定，独立的桶也易于高并发。缺点是至少要两次内存跳转：先跳到桶入口，再跳到桶中的第一个节点。对于一些很小的表这个问题不明显，因为当表很小时，节点内存是接近的，但当表变大时，访存就愈发随机。如果一次访存在50ns左右（2G左右主频），开链哈希的查找时间往往就在100ns以上。在检索端的层层ranking过程中，对一些热点字典的查找1秒内可能有几百万次以上，开链哈希有时会成为热点。一些产品线可能对开链哈希的内存也有诟病，因为每对key/value都需要额外的指针。 闭链哈希(closed hashing or open addressing): 闭链的初衷是减少内存跳转，桶不再是链表入口，而只需要记录一对key/value与一些标记，当桶被占时，按照不同的探查方法直到找到空桶为止。比如线性探查就是查找下一个桶，二次探查是按1,2,4,9\u0026hellip;平方数位移查找。优点是：当表很空时或冲突较少时，查找只需要一次访存，也不需要管理节点内存池。但仅此而已，这个方法带来了更多缺点：桶个数必须大于元素个数，resize后之前的内存全部失效，难以并发. 更关键的是聚集效应：当区域内元素较多时（超过70%，其实不算多），大量元素的实际桶和它们应在的桶有较大位移。这使哈希表的主要操作都要扫过一大片内存才能找到元素，性能不稳定难以预测。闭链哈希表在很多人的印象中“很快”，但在复杂的应用中往往不如开链哈希表，并且可能是数量级的慢。闭链有一些衍生版本试图解决这个问题，比如Hopscotch hashing。 混合开链和闭链：一般是把桶数组中的一部分拿出来作为容纳冲突元素的空间，典型如Coalesced hashing，但这种结构没有解决开链的内存跳转问题，结构又比闭链复杂很多，工程效果并不好。 多次哈希：一般用多个哈希表代替一个哈希表，当发生冲突时（用另一个哈希值）尝试另一个哈希表。典型如Cuckoo hashing，这个结构也没有解决内存跳转。 ","excerpt":"NAME FlatMap -

three mechanisms to operate IO in general:\nBlocking IO: once an IO operation is issued, the calling thread is blocked until the IO ends, which is a kind of synchronous IO, such as default actions of posix read and write. Non-blocking IO: If there is nothing to read or too much to write, APIs that would block return immediately with an error code. Non-blocking IO is often used with IO multiplexing(poll, select, epoll in Linux or kqueue in BSD). Asynchronous IO: Start a read or write operation with a callback, which will be called when the IO is done, such as OVERLAPPED + IOCP in Windows. Native AIO in Linux only supports files. Non-blocking IO is usually used for increasing IO concurrency in Linux. When the IO concurrency is low, non-blocking IO is not necessarily more efficient than blocking IO, which is handled completely by the kernel. System calls like read/write are highly optimized and probably more efficient. But when IO concurrency increases, the drawback of blocking-one-thread in blocking IO arises: the kernel keeps switching between threads to do effective jobs, and a CPU core may only do a little bit of work before being replaced by another thread, causing CPU cache not fully utilized. In addition a large number of threads decrease performance of code dependent on thread-local variables, such as tcmalloc. Once malloc slows down, the overall performance of the program decreases as well. As a contrast, non-blocking IO is typically composed with a relatively small number of event dispatching threads and worker threads(running user code), which are reused by different tasks (in another word, part of scheduling work is moved to userland). Event dispatchers and workers run on different CPU cores simultaneously without frequent switches in the kernel. There\u0026rsquo;s no need to have many threads, so the use of thread-local variables is also more adequate. All these factors make non-blocking IO faster than blocking IO. But non-blocking IO also has its own problems, one of which is more system calls, such as epoll_ctl. Since epoll is implemented as a red-black tree, epoll_ctl is not a very fast operation, especially in multi-threaded environments. Implementations heavily dependent on epoll_ctl is often confronted with multi-core scalability issues. Non-blocking IO also has to solve a lot of multi-threaded problems, producing more complex code than blocking IO.\nReceiving messages A message is a bounded binary data read from a connection, which may be a request from upstream clients or a response from downstream servers. brpc uses one or several EventDispatcher(referred to as EDISP) to wait for events from file descriptors. Unlike the common \u0026ldquo;IO threads\u0026rdquo;, EDISP is not responsible for reading or writing. The problem of IO threads is that one thread can only read one fd at a given time, other reads may be delayed when many fds in one IO thread are busy. Multi-tenancy, complicated load balancing and Streaming RPC worsen the problem. Under high workloads, regular long delays on one fd may slow down all fds in the IO thread, causing more long tails.\nBecause of a bug of epoll (at the time of developing brpc) and overhead of epoll_ctl, edge triggered mode is used in EDISP. After receiving an event, an atomic variable associated with the fd is added by one atomically. If the variable is zero before addition, a bthread is started to handle the data from the fd. The pthread worker in which EDISP runs is yielded to the newly created bthread to make it start reading ASAP and have a better cache locality. The bthread in which EDISP runs will be stolen to another pthread and keep running, this mechanism is work stealing used in bthreads. To understand exactly how that atomic variable works, you can read atomic instructions first, then check Socket::StartInputEvent. These methods make contentions on dispatching events of one fd wait-free.\nInputMessenger cuts messages and uses customizable callbacks to handle different format of data. Parse callback cuts messages from binary data and has relatively stable running time; Process parses messages further(such as parsing by protobuf) and calls users\u0026rsquo; callbacks, which vary in running time. If n(n \u0026gt; 1) messages are read from the fd, InputMessenger launches n-1 bthreads to handle first n-1 messages respectively, and processes the last message in-place. InputMessenger tries protocols one by one. Since one connections often has only one type of messages, InputMessenger remembers current protocol to avoid trying for protocols next time.\nIt can be seen that messages from different fds or even same fd are processed concurrently in brpc, which makes brpc good at handling large messages and reducing long tails on processing messages from different sources under high workloads.\nSending Messages A message is a bounded binary data written to a connection, which may be a response to upstream clients or a request to downstream servers. Multiple threads may send messages to a fd at the same time, however writing to a fd is non-atomic, so how to queue writes from different thread efficiently is a key technique. brpc uses a special wait-free MPSC list to solve the issue. All data ready to write is put into a node of a singly-linked list, whose next pointer points to a special value(Socket::WriteRequest::UNCONNECTED). When a thread wants to write out some data, it tries to atomically exchange the node with the list head(Socket::_write_head) first. If the head before exchange is empty, the caller gets the right to write and writes out the data in-place once. Otherwise there must be another thread writing. The caller points the next pointer to the head returned to make the linked list connected. The thread that is writing will see the new head later and write new data.\nThis method makes the writing contentions wait-free. Although the thread that gets the right to write is not wait-free nor lock-free in principle and may be blocked by a node that is still UNCONNECTED(the thread issuing write is swapped out by OS just after atomic exchange and before setting the next pointer, within execution time of just one instruction), the blocking rarely happens in practice. In current implementations, if the data cannot be written fully in one call, a KeepWrite bthread is created to write the remaining data. This mechanism is pretty complicated and the principle is depicted below. Read socket.cpp for more details.\nSince writes in brpc always complete within short time, the calling thread can handle new tasks more quickly and background KeepWrite threads also get more tasks to write in one batch, forming pipelines and increasing the efficiency of IO at high throughputs.\nSocket Socket contains data structures related to fd and is one of the most complex structure in brpc. The unique feature of this structure is that it uses 64-bit SocketId to refer to a Socket object to facilitate usages of fd in multi-threaded environments. Commonly used methods:\nCreate: create a Socket and return its SocketId. Address: retrieve Socket from an id, and wrap it into a unique_ptr(SocketUniquePtr) that will be automatically released. When Socket is set failed, the pointer returned is empty. As long as Address returns a non-null pointer, the contents are guaranteed to not change until the pointer is destructed. This function is wait-free. SetFailed: Mark a Socket as failed and Address() on corresponding SocketId will return empty pointer (until health checking resumes the socket). Sockets are recycled when no one is referencing it anymore. This function is lock-free. We can see that, Socket is similar to shared_ptr in the sense of referential counting and SocketId is similar to weak_ptr. The unique SetFailed prevents Socket from being addressed so that the reference count can hit zero finally. Simply using shared_ptr/weak_ptr cannot guarantee this. For example, when a server needs to quit when requests are still coming in frequently, the reference count of Socket may not hit zero and the server is unable to stop quickly. What\u0026rsquo; more, weak_ptr cannot be directly put into epoll data, but SocketId can. These factors lead to design of Socket which is stable and rarely changed since 2014.\nUsing SocketUniquePtr or SocketId depends on if a strong reference is needed. For example, Controller is used thoroughly inside RPC and has a lot of interactions with Socket, it uses SocketUniquePtr. Epoll notifies events on fds and events of a recycled socket can be ignored, so epoll uses SocketId.\nAs long as SocketUniquePtr is valid, the Socket enclosed will not be changed so that users have no need to care about race conditions and ABA problems, being safer to operate the shared socket. This method also circumvents implicit referential counting and makes ownership of memory more clear, producing better-quality programs. brpc uses SocketUniquePtr and SocketId a lot to simplify related issues.\nIn fact, Socket manages not only the native fd but also other resources, such as SubChannel in SelectiveChannel is also managed by Socket, making SelectiveChannel choose a SubChannel just like a normal channel choosing a downstream server. The faked Socket even implements health checking. Streaming RPC also uses Socket to reuse the code on wait-free write.\nThe full picture ","excerpt":"There are three mechanisms to operate IO in general:\nBlocking IO: once an IO operation is issued, …","ref":"https://brpc.incubator.apache.org/docs/rpc-in-depth/io/","title":"IO"},{"body":"rpc_view可以转发端口被限的server的内置服务。像百度内如果一个服务的端口不在8000-8999，就只能在命令行下使用curl查看它的内置服务，没有历史趋势和动态曲线，也无法点击链接，排查问题不方便。rpc_view是一个特殊的http proxy：把对它的所有访问都转为对目标server的访问。只要把rpc_view的端口能在浏览器中被访问，我们就能通过它看到原本不能直接看到的server了。\n获取工具 先按照Getting Started编译好brpc，再去tools/rpc_view编译。\n在CentOS 6.3上如果出现找不到libssl.so.4的错误，可执行ln -s /usr/lib64/libssl.so.6 libssl.so.4临时解决\n访问目标server 确保你的机器能访问目标server，开发机应该都可以，一些测试机可能不行。运行./rpc_view 就可以了。\n比如：\n$ ./rpc_view 10.46.130.53:9970 TRACE: 02-14 12:12:20: * 0 src/brpc/server.cpp:762] Server[rpc_view_server] is serving on port=8888.

The implementation reduces cache bouncing by storing data in thread local storage(TLS), being much faster than UbMonitor(a legacy counting library inside Baidu) and even atomic operations in highly contended scenarios. brpc integrates bvar by default, namely all exposed bvars in a server are accessible through /vars, and a single bvar is addressable by /vars/VARNAME. Read bvar to know how to add bvars for your program. brpc extensively use bvar to expose internal status. If you are looking for an utility to collect and display metrics of your application, consider bvar in the first place. bvar definitely can\u0026rsquo;t replace all counters, essentially it moves contentions occurred during write to read: which needs to combine all data written by all threads and becomes much slower than an ordinary read. If read and write on the counter are both frequent or decisions need to be made based on latest values, you should not use bvar.\nQuery methods /vars : List all exposed bvars\n/vars/NAME：List the bvar whose name is NAME\n/vars/NAME1,NAME2,NAME3：List bvars whose names are either NAME1, NAME2 or NAME3.\n/vars/foo*,b$r: List bvars whose names match given wildcard patterns. Note that $ matches a single character instead of ? which is a reserved character in URL.\nFollowing animation shows how to find bvars with wildcard patterns. You can copy and paste the URL to others who will see same bvars that you see. (values may change)\nThere\u0026rsquo;s a search box in the upper-left corner on /vars page, in which you can type part of the names to locate bvars. Different patterns are separated by , : or space.\n/vars is accessible from terminal as well:\n$ curl brpc.baidu.com:8765/vars/bthread* bthread_creation_count : 125134 bthread_creation_latency : 3 bthread_creation_latency_50 : 3 bthread_creation_latency_90 : 5 bthread_creation_latency_99 : 7 bthread_creation_latency_999 : 12 bthread_creation_latency_9999 : 12 bthread_creation_latency_cdf : \u0026#34;click to view\u0026#34; bthread_creation_latency_percentiles : \u0026#34;[3,5,7,12]\u0026#34; bthread_creation_max_latency : 7 bthread_creation_qps : 100 bthread_group_status : \u0026#34;0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u0026#34; bthread_num_workers : 24 bthread_worker_usage : 1.01056 View historical trends Clicking on most of the numerical bvars shows historical trends. Each clickable bvar records values in recent 60 seconds, 60 minutes, 24 hours and 30 days, which are 174 numbers in total. 1000 clickable bvars take roughly 1M memory.\nCalculate and view percentiles x-ile (short for x-th percentile) is the value ranked at N * x%-th position amongst a group of ordered values. E.g. If there\u0026rsquo;re 1000 values inside a time window, sort them in ascending order first. The 500-th value(1000 * 50%) in the ordered list is 50-ile(a.k.a median), the 990-th(1000 * 99%) value is 99-ile, the 999-th value is 99.9-ile. Percentiles give more information on how latencies distribute than mean values, and being helpful for analyzing behavior of the system more accurately. Industrial-grade services often require SLA to be not less than 99.97% (the requirement for 2nd-level services inside Baidu, \u0026gt;=99.99% for 1st-level services), even if a system has good average latencies, a bad long-tail area may still break SLA. Percentiles do help analyzing the long-tail area.\nPercentiles can be plotted as a CDF or percentiles-over-time curve.\nFollowing diagram plots percentiles as CDF, where the X-axis is the ratio(ranked-position/total-number) and the Y-axis is the corresponding percentile. E.g. The Y value corresponding to X=50% is 50-ile. If a system requires that \u0026ldquo;99.9% requests need to be processed within Y milliseconds\u0026rdquo;, you should check the Y at 99.9%.\nWhy do we call it CDF ? When a Y=y is chosen, the corresponding X means \u0026ldquo;percentage of values \u0026lt;= y\u0026rdquo;. Since values are sampled randomly (and uniformly), the X can be viewed as \u0026ldquo;probability of values \u0026lt;= y\u0026rdquo;, or P(values \u0026lt;= y), which is just the definition of CDF.\nDerivative of the CDF is PDF. If we divide the Y-axis of the CDF into many small-range segments, calculate the difference between X values of both ends of each segment, and use the difference as new value for X-axis, a PDF curve would be plotted, just like a normal distribution rotated 90 degrees clockwise. However density of the median is often much higher than others in a PDF and probably make long-tail area very flat and hard to read. As a result, systems prefer showing distributions in CDF rather than PDF.\nHere\u0026rsquo;re 2 simple rules to check if a CDF curve is good or not:\nThe flatter the better. A horizontal line is an ideal CDF curve which means that there\u0026rsquo;re no waitings, congestions or pauses, very unlikely in practice. The area between 99% and 100% should be as small as possible: right-side of 99% is the long-tail area, which has a significant impact on SLA. A CDF with slowly ascending curve and small long-tail area is great in practice.\nFollowing diagram plots percentiles over time and has four curves. The X-axis is time and Y-axis from top to bottom are 99.9% 99% 90% 50% percentiles respectively, plotted in lighter and lighter colors (from orange to yellow).\nHovering mouse over the curves shows corresponding values at the time. The tooltip in above diagram means \u0026ldquo;The 99% percentile of latency before 39 seconds is 330 microseconds\u0026rdquo;. The diagram does not include the 99.99-ile curve which is usually significantly higher than others, making others hard to read. You may click bvars ended with \u0026ldquo;_latency_9999\u0026rdquo; to read the 99.99-ile curve separately. This diagram shows how percentiles change over time, which is helpful to analyze performance regressions of systems.\nbrpc calculates latency distributions of services automatically, which do not need users to add manually. The metrics are as follows:\nbvar::LatencyRecorder is able to calculate latency distributions of any code, as depicted below. (checkout bvar-c++ for details):\n#include \u0026lt;bvar/bvar.h\u0026gt; ... bvar::LatencyRecorder g_latency_recorder(\u0026#34;client\u0026#34;); // expose this recorder ... void foo() { ... g_latency_recorder \u0026lt;\u0026lt; my_latency; ... } If the application already starts a brpc server, values like client_latency, client_latency_cdf can be viewed from /vars as follows. Clicking them to see (dynamically-updated) curves:\nNon brpc server If your program only uses brpc client or even not use brpc, and you also want to view the curves, check here.\n","excerpt":"bvar is a set of counters to record and view miscellaneous statistics conveniently in multi-threaded …","ref":"https://brpc.incubator.apache.org/docs/builtin-services/vars/","title":"vars"},{"body":"Example example/http_c++\nAbout h2 brpc names the HTTP/2 protocol to \u0026ldquo;h2\u0026rdquo;, no matter encrypted or not. However HTTP/2 connections without SSL are shown on /connections with the official name \u0026ldquo;h2c\u0026rdquo;, and the ones with SSL are shown as \u0026ldquo;h2\u0026rdquo;.\nThe APIs for http and h2 in brpc are basically same. Without explicit statement, mentioned http features work for h2 as well.\nCreate Channel In order to use brpc::Channel to access http/h2 services, ChannelOptions.protocol must be set to PROTOCOL_HTTP or PROTOCOL_H2.\nOnce the protocol is set, the first parameter of Channel::Init can be any valid URL. Note: Only host and port inside the URL are used by Init(), other parts are discarded. Allowing full URL simply saves the user from additional parsing code.\nbrpc::ChannelOptions options; options.protocol = brpc::PROTOCOL_HTTP; // or brpc::PROTOCOL_H2 if (channel.Init(\u0026#34;www.baidu.com\u0026#34; /*any url*/, \u0026amp;options) != 0) { LOG(ERROR) \u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0026#34;Fail to initialize channel\u0026#34;; return -1; } http/h2 channel also support BNS address or other naming services.\nGET brpc::Controller cntl; cntl.http_request().uri() = \u0026#34;www.baidu.com/index.html\u0026#34;; // Request URL channel.CallMethod(NULL, \u0026amp;cntl, NULL, NULL, NULL/*done*/); http/h2 does not relate to protobuf much, thus all parameters of CallMethod are NULL except Controller and done. Issue asynchronous RPC with non-NULL done.\ncntl.response_attachment() is body of the http/h2 response and typed butil::IOBuf. IOBuf can be converted to std::string by to_string(), which needs to allocate memory and copy all data. If performance is important, the code should consider supporting IOBuf directly rather than requiring continuous memory.\nPOST The default HTTP Method is GET, which can be changed to POST or other http methods. The data to POST should be put into request_attachment(), which is typed butil::IOBuf and able to append std :: string or char * directly.\nbrpc::Controller cntl; cntl.http_request().uri() = \u0026#34;...\u0026#34;; // Request URL cntl.http_request().set_method(brpc::HTTP_METHOD_POST); cntl.request_attachment().append(\u0026#34;{\\\u0026#34;message\\\u0026#34;:\\\u0026#34;hello world!\\\u0026#34;}\u0026#34;); channel.CallMethod(NULL, \u0026amp;cntl, NULL, NULL, NULL/*done*/); If the body needs a lot of printing to build, consider using butil::IOBufBuilder, which has same interfaces as std::ostringstream, probably simpler and more efficient than c-style printf when lots of objects need to be printed.\nbrpc::Controller cntl; cntl.http_request().uri() = \u0026#34;...\u0026#34;; // Request URL cntl.http_request().set_method(brpc::HTTP_METHOD_POST); butil::IOBufBuilder os; os \u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0026#34;A lot of printing\u0026#34; \u0026lt;\u0026lt; printable_objects \u0026lt;\u0026lt; ...; os.move_to(cntl.request_attachment()); channel.CallMethod(NULL, \u0026amp;cntl, NULL, NULL, NULL/*done*/); Change HTTP version brpc behaves as http/1.1 by default.\nComparing to http/1.1, http/1.0 lacks of long connections(KeepAlive). To communicate brpc client with some legacy http servers, the client may be configured as follows:\ncntl.http_request().set_version(1, 0); Setting http version does not work for h2, but the versions in h2 responses received by client and h2 requests received by server are set to (2, 0).\nbrpc server recognizes http versions automically and responds accordingly without users\u0026rsquo; aid.\nURL Genaral form of an URL:\n// URI scheme : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URI_scheme // // foo://username:password@example.com:8042/over/there/index.dtb?type=animal\u0026amp;name=narwhal#nose // \\_/ \\_______________/ \\_________/ \\__/ \\___/ \\_/ \\______________________/ \\__/ // | | | | | | | | // | userinfo host port | | query fragment // | \\________________________________/\\_____________|____|/ \\__/ \\__/ // scheme | | | | | | // authority | | | | | // path | | interpretable as keys // | | // \\_______________________________________________|____|/ \\____/ \\_____/ // | | | | | // hierarchical part | | interpretable as values // | | // interpretable as filename | // | // | // interpretable as extension As we saw in examples above, Channel.Init() and cntl.http_request().uri() both need the URL. Why does uri() need to be set additionally rather than using the URL to Init() directly?\nIndeed, the settings are repeated in simple cases. But they are different in more complex scenes:\nAccess multiple servers under a NamingService (for example BNS), in which case Channel::Init accepts a name meaningful to the NamingService(for example node names in BNS), while uri() is assigned with the URL. Access servers via http/h2 proxy, in which case Channel::Init takes the address of the proxy server, while uri() is still assigned with the URL. Host header If user already sets Host header(case insensitive), framework makes no change.\nIf user does not set Host header and the URL has host, for example http://www.foo.com/path, the http request contains \u0026ldquo;Host: www.foo.com\u0026rdquo;.\nIf user does not set host header and the URL does not have host as well, for example \u0026ldquo;/index.html?name=value\u0026rdquo;, but if the address initialized by the channel contains domain name. framework sets Host header with domain name of the target server. if this address is \u0026ldquo;http://www.foo.com\u0026rdquo;, this http server should see Host: www.foo.com, if this address is \u0026ldquo;http://www.foo.com:8989\u0026rdquo;, this http server should be see Host: www.foo.com:8989.\nIf user does not set host header and the URL does not have host as well, for example \u0026ldquo;/index.html?name=value\u0026rdquo;, and the address initialized by the channel doesn\u0026rsquo;t contain domain name. framework sets Host header with IP and port of the target server. A http server at 10.46.188.39:8989 should see Host: 10.46.188.39:8989.\nThe header is named \u0026ldquo;:authority\u0026rdquo; in h2.\nCommon usages Take http request as an example (similar with http response), common operations are listed as follows:\nAccess an HTTP header named Foo\nconst std::string* value = cntl-\u0026gt;http_request().GetHeader(\u0026#34;Foo\u0026#34;); // NULL when not exist Set an HTTP header named Foo\ncntl-\u0026gt;http_request().SetHeader(\u0026#34;Foo\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;); Access a query named Foo\nconst std::string* value = cntl-\u0026gt;http_request().uri().GetQuery(\u0026#34;Foo\u0026#34;); // NULL when not exist Set a query named Foo\ncntl-\u0026gt;http_request().uri().SetQuery(\u0026#34;Foo\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;); Set HTTP method\ncntl-\u0026gt;http_request().set_method(brpc::HTTP_METHOD_POST); Set the URL\ncntl-\u0026gt;http_request().uri() = \u0026#34;http://www.baidu.com\u0026#34;; Set the content-type\ncntl-\u0026gt;http_request().set_content_type(\u0026#34;text/plain\u0026#34;); Get HTTP body\nbutil::IOBuf\u0026amp; buf = cntl-\u0026gt;request_attachment(); std::string str = cntl-\u0026gt;request_attachment().to_string(); // trigger copy underlying Set HTTP body\ncntl-\u0026gt;request_attachment().append(\u0026#34;....\u0026#34;); butil::IOBufBuilder os; os \u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0026#34;....\u0026#34;; os.move_to(cntl-\u0026gt;request_attachment()); Notes on http header:\nfield_name of the header is case-insensitive according to rfc2616. brpc supports case-insensitive field names and keeps same cases at printing as users set. If multiple headers have same field names, according to rfc2616, values should be merged and separated by comma (,). Users figure out how to use this kind of values by their own. Queries are separated by \u0026ldquo;\u0026amp;\u0026rdquo; and key/value in a query are separated by \u0026ldquo;=\u0026rdquo;. Values can be omitted. For example, key1=value1\u0026amp;key2\u0026amp;key3=value3 is a valid query string, in which the value for key2 is an empty string. Debug HTTP messages Turn on -http_verbose so that the framework prints each http request and response. Note that this should only be used in tests or debuggings rather than online services.\nHTTP errors When server returns a non-2xx HTTP status code, the HTTP RPC is considered to be failed and cntl-\u0026gt;ErrorCode() at client-side is set to EHTTP, users can check cntl-\u0026gt; http_response().status_code() for more specific HTTP error. In addition, server can put html or json describing the error into cntl-\u0026gt;response_attachment() which is sent back to the client as http body.\nCompress Request Body Controller::set_request_compress_type(brpc::COMPRESS_TYPE_GZIP) makes framework try to gzip the HTTP body. \u0026ldquo;try to\u0026rdquo; means the compression may not happen, because:\nSize of body is smaller than bytes specified by -http_body_compress_threshold, which is 512 by default. The reason is that gzip is not a very fast compression algorithm, when body is small, the delay caused by compression may even larger than the latency saved by faster transportation. Decompress Response Body brpc does not decompress bodies of responses automatically due to universality. The decompression code is not complicated and users can do it by themselves. The code is as follows:\n#include \u0026lt;brpc/policy/gzip_compress.h\u0026gt; ... const std::string* encoding = cntl-\u0026gt;http_response().GetHeader(\u0026#34;Content-Encoding\u0026#34;); if (encoding != NULL \u0026amp;\u0026amp; *encoding == \u0026#34;gzip\u0026#34;) { butil::IOBuf uncompressed; if (!brpc::policy::GzipDecompress(cntl-\u0026gt;response_attachment(), \u0026amp;uncompressed)) { LOG(ERROR) \u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0026#34;Fail to un-gzip response body\u0026#34;; return; } cntl-\u0026gt;response_attachment().swap(uncompressed); } // Now cntl-\u0026gt;response_attachment() contains the decompressed data Progressively Download http client normally does not complete the RPC until http body has been fully downloaded. During the process http body is stored in memory. If the body is very large or infinitely large(a FLV file for live streaming), memory grows continuously until the RPC is timedout. Such http clients are not suitable for downloading very large files.\nbrpc client supports completing RPC before reading the full body, so that users can read http bodies progressively after RPC. Note that this feature does not mean \u0026ldquo;support for http chunked mode\u0026rdquo;, actually the http implementation in brpc supports chunked mode from the very beginning. The real issue is how to let users handle very or infinitely large http bodies, which does not imply the chunked mode.\nHow to use:\nImplement ProgressiveReader below:\n#include \u0026lt;brpc/progressive_reader.h\u0026gt; ... class ProgressiveReader { public: // Called when one part was read. // Error returned is treated as *permenant* and the socket where the // data was read will be closed. // A temporary error may be handled by blocking this function, which // may block the HTTP parsing on the socket. virtual butil::Status OnReadOnePart(const void* data, size_t length) = 0; // Called when there\u0026#39;s nothing to read anymore. The `status\u0026#39; is a hint for // why this method is called. // - status.ok(): the message is complete and successfully consumed. // - otherwise: socket was broken or OnReadOnePart() failed. // This method will be called once and only once. No other methods will // be called after. User can release the memory of this object inside. virtual void OnEndOfMessage(const butil::Status\u0026amp; status) = 0; }; OnReadOnePart is called each time a piece of data is read. OnEndOfMessage is called at the end of data or the connection is broken. Read comments carefully before implementing.\nSet cntl.response_will_be_read_progressively(); before RPC to make brpc end RPC just after reading all headers.\nCall cntl.ReadProgressiveAttachmentBy(new MyProgressiveReader); after RPC. MyProgressiveReader is an instance of user-implemented ProgressiveReader. User may delete the object inside OnEndOfMessage.\nProgressively Upload Currently the POST data should be intact before launching the http call, thus brpc http client is still not suitable for uploading very large bodies.\nAccess Servers with authentications Generate auth_data according to authenticating method of the server and set it into Authorization header. If you\u0026rsquo;re using curl, add option -H \u0026quot;Authorization : \u0026lt;auth_data\u0026gt;\u0026quot;.\nSend https requests https is short for \u0026ldquo;http over SSL\u0026rdquo;, SSL is not exclusive for http, but effective for all protocols. The generic method for turning on client-side SSL is here. brpc enables SSL automatically for URIs starting with https:// to make the usage more handy.\n","excerpt":"Example example/http_c++\nAbout h2 brpc names the HTTP/2 protocol to \u0026ldquo;h2\u0026rdquo;, no matter …","ref":"https://brpc.incubator.apache.org/docs/client/access-httph2/","title":"Access http:h2"},{"body":"可代替ab测试http server极限性能。ab功能较多但年代久远，有时本身可能会成为瓶颈。benchmark_http基本上就是一个brpc http client，性能很高，功能较少，一般压测够用了。\n使用方法：\n首先你得下载和编译了brpc源码，然后去example/http_c++目录编译，成功后应该能看到benchmark_http。\n","excerpt":"可代替ab测试http server极限性能。ab功能较多但年代久远，有时本身可能会成为瓶颈。benchmark_http基本上就是一个brpc http client，性能很高，功能较少，一般压测够 …","ref":"https://brpc.incubator.apache.org/docs/tools/benchmark_http/","title":"benchmark_http"},{"body":" bRPC外功修炼宝典 A tutorial on building large-scale services bRPC Internal ","excerpt":" bRPC外功修炼宝典 A tutorial on building large-scale services bRPC Internal ","ref":"https://brpc.incubator.apache.org/docs/c++-base/brpc-training-materials/","title":"bRPC Training Materials"},{"body":"connections服务可以查看所有的连接。一个典型的页面如下：\nserver_socket_count: 5\nCreatedTime RemoteSide SSL Protocol fd BytesIn/s In/s BytesOut/s Out/s BytesIn/m In/m BytesOut/m Out/m SocketId 2015/09/21-21:32:09.630840 172.22.38.217:51379 No http 19 1300 1 269 1 68844 53 115860 53 257 2015/09/21-21:32:09.630857 172.22.38.217:51380 No http 20 1308 1 5766 1 68884 53 129978 53 258 2015/09/21-21:32:09.630880 172.22.38.217:51381 No http 21 1292 1 1447 1 67672 52 143414 52 259 2015/09/21-21:32:01.324587 127.0.0.1:55385 No baidu_std 15 1480 20 880 20 88020 1192 52260 1192 512 2015/09/21-21:32:01.325969 127.0.0.1:55387 No baidu_std 17 4016 40 1554 40 238879 2384 92660 2384 1024 channel_socket_count: 1\nCreatedTime RemoteSide SSL Protocol fd BytesIn/s In/s BytesOut/s Out/s BytesIn/m In/m BytesOut/m Out/m SocketId 2015/09/21-21:32:01.325870 127.0.0.1:8765 No baidu_std 16 1554 40 4016 40 92660 2384 238879 2384 0 channel_short_socket_count: 0\n上述信息分为三段：\n第一段是server接受(accept)的连接。 第二段是server与下游的单连接（使用brpc::Channel建立），fd为-1的是虚拟连接，对应第三段中所有相同RemoteSide的连接。 第三段是server与下游的短连接或连接池(pooled connections)，这些连接从属于第二段中的相同RemoteSide的虚拟连接。 表格标题的含义：\nRemoteSide : 远端的ip和端口。 SSL：是否使用SSL加密，若为Yes的话，一般是HTTPS连接。 Protocol : 使用的协议，可能为baidu_std hulu_pbrpc sofa_pbrpc memcache http public_pbrpc nova_pbrpc nshead_server等。 fd : file descriptor（文件描述符），可能为-1。 BytesIn/s : 上一秒读入的字节数 In/s : 上一秒读入的消息数（消息是对request和response的统称） BytesOut/s : 上一秒写出的字节数 Out/s : 上一秒写出的消息数 BytesIn/m: 上一分钟读入的字节数 In/m: 上一分钟读入的消息数 BytesOut/m: 上一分钟写出的字节数 Out/m: 上一分钟写出的消息数 SocketId ：内部id，用于debug，用户不用关心。 典型截图分别如下所示：\n单连接：\n连接池：\n短连接：\n","excerpt":"connections服务可以查看所有的连接。一个典型的页面如下：\nserver_socket_count: 5\nCreatedTime RemoteSide SSL Protocol fd …","ref":"https://brpc.incubator.apache.org/docs/builtin-services/connections/","title":"connections"},{"body":"thrift is a RPC framework used widely in various environments, which was developed by Facebook and adopted by Apache later.

When number of connections increases, resources occupied by threads/processes and costs of context switches becomes more and more overwhelming, making servers perform poorly. This situation is summarized as the C10K problem, which was common in early web servers but rarely present today.\nSingle-threaded reactor Event-loop libraries such as libevent, libev are typical examples. There\u0026rsquo;s usually an event dispatcher in this model responsible for waiting on different kinds of events and calling the corresponding event handler in-place when an event occurs. After all handlers(that need to be called) are called, the dispatcher waits for more events again, which forms a \u0026ldquo;loop\u0026rdquo;. Essentially this model multiplexes(interleaves) code written in different handlers into a system thread. One event-loop can only utilize one core, so this kind of program is either IO-bound or each handler runs within short and deterministic time(such as http servers), otherwise one callback taking long time blocks the whole program and causes high delays. In practice this kind of program is not suitable for involving many developers, because just one person adding inappropriate blocking code may significantly slow down reactivities of all other code. Since event handlers don\u0026rsquo;t run simultaneously, race conditions between callbacks are relatively simple and in some scenarios locks are not needed. These programs are often scaled by using more threads or more processes.\nHow single-threaded reactors work and the problems related are demonstrated below: (The Chinese characters in red: \u0026ldquo;Uncontrollable! unless the service is specialized\u0026rdquo;)\nN:1 threading library Also known as Fiber. Typical examples are GNU Pth, StateThreads. This model maps N user threads into a single system thread, in which only one user thread runs at the same time and the running user thread does not switch to other user threads until a blocking primitive is called (cooperative). N:1 threading libraries are equal to single-threaded reactors on capabilities, except that callbacks are replaced by contexts (stacks, registers, signals) and running callbacks becomes jumping to contexts. Similar to event-loop libraries, a N:1 threading library cannot utilize multiple CPU cores, thus only suitable for specialized applications. However a single system thread is more friendly to CPU caches, with removal of the support for signal masks, context switches between user threads can be done very fast(100 ~ 200ns). N:1 threading libraries perform as well as event-loop libraries and are also scaled by using more threads or more processes in general.\nMulti-threaded reactor boost::asio is a typical example. One or several threads run event dispatchers respectively. When an event occurs, the event handler is queued into a worker thread to run. This model is extensible from single-threaded reactor intuitively and able to make use of multiple CPU cores. Since sharing memory addresses makes interactions between threads much cheaper, the worker threads are able to balance loads between each other frequently, as a contrast multiple single-threaded reactors basically depend on the front-end servers to distribute traffic. A well-implemented multi-threaded reactor is likely to utilize CPU cores more evenly than multiple single-threaded reactors on the same machine. However, due to cache coherence, multi-threaded reactors are unlikely to achieve linear scalability on CPU cores. In particular scenarios, a badly implemented multi-threaded reactor running on 24 cores is even slower than a well-tuned single-threaded reactor. Because a multi-threaded reactor has multiple worker threads, one blocking event handler may not delay other handlers. As a result, event handlers are not required to be non-blocking unless all worker threads are blocked, in which case the overall progress is affected. In fact, most RPC frameworks are implemented in this model with event handlers that may block, such as synchronously waiting for RPCs to downstream servers.\nHow multi-threaded reactors work and problems related are demonstrated below:\nM:N threading library This model maps M user threads into N system threads. A M:N threading library is able to decide when and where to run a piece of code and when to end the execution, which is more flexible at scheduling compared to multi-threaded reactors. But full-featured M:N threading libraries are difficult to implement and remaining as active research topics. The M:N threading library that we\u0026rsquo;re talking about is specialized for building online services, in which case, some of the requirements can be simplified, namely no (complete) preemptions and priorities. M:N threading libraries can be implemented either in userland or OS kernel. New programming languages prefer implementations in userland, such as GHC thread and goroutine, which is capable of adding brand-new keywords and intercepting related APIs on threading. Implementation in existing languages often have to modify the OS kernel, such as Windows UMS and google SwicthTo(which is 1:1, however M:N effects can be achieved based on it). Compared to N:1 threading libraries, usages of M:N threading libraries are more similar to system threads, which need locks or message passings to ensure thread safety.\nIssues Multi-core scalability Ideally capabilities of the reactor model are maximized when all source code is programmed in event-driven manner, but in reality because of the difficulties and maintainability, users are likely to mix usages: synchronous IO is often issued in callbacks, blocking worker threads from processing other requests. A request often goes through dozens of services, making worker threads spend a lot of time waiting for responses from downstream servers. Users have to launch hundreds of threads to maintain enough throughput, which imposes intensive pressure on scheduling and lowers efficiencies of TLS related code. Tasks are often pushed into a queue protected with a global mutex and condition, which performs poorly when many threads are contending for it. A better approach is to deploy more task queues and adjust the scheduling algorithm to reduce global contentions. Namely each system thread has its own runqueue, and one or more schedulers dispatch user threads to different runqueues. Each system thread runs user threads from its own runqueue before considering other runqueues, which is more complicated but more scalable than the global mutex+condition solution. This model is also easier to support NUMA.\nWhen an event dispatcher passes a task to a worker thread, the user code probably jumps from one CPU core to another, which may need to wait for synchronizations of relevant cachelines, which is not very fast. It would be better that the worker is able to run directly on the CPU core where the event dispatcher runs, since at most of the time, priority of running the worker ASAP is higher than getting new events from the dispatcher. Similarly, it\u0026rsquo;s better to wake up the user thread blocking on RPC on the same CPU core where the response is received.\nAsynchronous programming Flow controls in asynchronous programming are even difficult for experts. Any suspending operation such as sleeping for a while or waiting for something to finish, implies that users have to save states explicitly and restore states in callbacks. Asynchronous code is often written as state machines. A few suspensions are troublesome, but still handleable. The problem is that once the suspension occurs inside a condition, loop or sub-function, it\u0026rsquo;s almost impossible to write such a state machine being understood and maintained by many people, although the scenario is quite common in distributed systems where a node often needs to interact with multiple nodes simultaneously. In addition, if the wakeup can be triggered by more than one events (such as either fd has data or timeout is reached), the suspension and resuming are prone to race conditions, which require good multi-threaded programming skills to solve. Syntactic sugars(such as lambda) just make coding less troublesome rather than reducing difficulty.\nShared pointers are common in asynchronous programming, which seems convenient, but also makes ownerships of memory elusive. If the memory is leaked, it\u0026rsquo;s difficult to locate the code that forgot to release; if segment fault happens, where the double-free occurs is also unknown. Code with a lot of referential countings is hard to remain good-quality and may waste a lot of time on debugging memory related issues. If references are even counted manually, keeping quality of the code is harder and the maintainers are less willing to modify the code. RAII cannot be used in many scenarios in asynchronous programming, sometimes resources need to be locked before a callback and unlocked inside the callback, which is very error-prone in practice.\n","excerpt":"Common threading models Connections own threads or processes exclusively In this model, a …","ref":"https://brpc.incubator.apache.org/docs/rpc-in-depth/threading-overview/","title":"Threading Overview"},{"body":"背景 云平台部把使用ubrpc的模块改造为使用brpc。由于使用了mcpack2pb的转换功能，这个模块既能被老的ubrpc client访问，也可以通过protobuf类的协议访问（baidu_std，sofa_pbrpc等）。\n原有使用43台机器（对ubrpc也有富余），brpc使用3台机器即可（此时访问redis的io达到瓶颈）。当前流量4w qps，支持流量增长，考虑跨机房冗余，避免redis和vip瓶颈，brpc实际使用8台机器提供服务。\nbrpc改造后的connecter收益明显，可以用较少的机器提供更优质的服务。收益分3个方面：\n相同配置的机器qps和latency的比较 通过逐渐缩容，不断增加connecter的压力，获得单机qps和latency的对应数据如下： 机器配置：cpu: 24 Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5645 @ 2.40GHz || mem: 64G\n混布情况：同机部署了逻辑层2.0/3.0和C逻辑层，均有流量\n图中可以看到随着压力的增大：\nbrpc的延时，增加微乎其微，提供了较为一致的延时体验 ubrpc的延时，快速增大，到了6000~8000qps的时候，出现queue full，服务不可用。 不同配置机器qps和延时的比较 qps固定为6500，观察延时。\n机器名称 略 略 cpu 24 Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5645 @ 2.40GHz 24 Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2620 0 @ 2.00GHz ubrpc 8363.46（us） 12649.5（us） brpc 3364.66（us） 3382.15（us） 有此可见：\nubrpc在不同配置下性能表现差异大，在配置较低的机器下表现较差。 brpc表现的比ubrpc好，在较低配置的机器上也能有好的表现，因机器不同带来的差异不大。 相同配置机器idle分布的比较 机器配置：cpu： 24 Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5645 @ 2.40GHz || mem：64G\n在线上缩容 不断增大压力过程中：\nubrpc cpu idle分布在35%~60%，在55%最集中，最低30%； brpc cpu idle分布在60%~85%，在75%最集中，最低50%； brpc比ubrpc对cpu的消耗低。 ","excerpt":"背景 云平台部把使用ubrpc的模块改造为使用brpc。由于使用了mcpack2pb的转换功能，这个模块既能被老的ubrpc client访问，也可以通过protobuf类的协议访 …","ref":"https://brpc.incubator.apache.org/docs/use-cases-inside-baidu/use-case4/","title":"云平台代理服务"},{"body":"Basics for accessing and serving http/h2 in brpc are listed in http_client and http_service.\nFollowing section names are protocol names that can be directly set to ChannelOptions.protocol.

# Domain Naming Service, aka DNS. 这套方式是可扩展的，实现了新的NamingService后在global.cpp中依葫芦画瓢注册下就行了，如下图所示：\n看到这些熟悉的字符串格式，容易联想到ftp:// zk:// galileo://等等都是可以支持的。用户在新建Channel时传入这类NamingService描述，并能把这些描述写在各类配置文件中。\n负载均衡 brpc中LoadBalancer从多个服务节点中选择一个节点，目前的实现见负载均衡。\nLoad balancer最重要的是如何让不同线程中的负载均衡不互斥，解决这个问题的技术是DoublyBufferedData。\n和NamingService类似，我们使用字符串来指代一个load balancer，在global.cpp中注册：\n健康检查 对于那些无法连接却仍在NamingService的节点，brpc会定期连接它们，成功后对应的Socket将被”复活“，并可能被LoadBalancer选择上，这个过程就是健康检查。注意：被健康检查或在LoadBalancer中的节点一定在NamingService中。换句话说，只要一个节点不从NamingService删除，它要么是正常的（会被LoadBalancer选上），要么在做健康检查。\n传统的做法是使用一个线程做所有连接的健康检查，brpc简化了这个过程：为需要的连接动态创建一个bthread专门做健康检查（Socket::HealthCheckThread）。这个线程的生命周期被对应连接管理。具体来说，当Socket被SetFailed后，健康检查线程就可能启动（如果SocketOptions.health_check_interval为正数的话）：\n健康检查线程先在确保没有其他人在使用Socket了后关闭连接。目前是通过对Socket的引用计数判断的。这个方法之所以有效在于Socket被SetFailed后就不能被Address了，所以引用计数只减不增。 定期连接直到远端机器被连接上，在这个过程中，如果Socket析构了，那么该线程也就随之退出了。 连上后复活Socket(Socket::Revive)，这样Socket就又能被其他地方，包括LoadBalancer访问到了（通过Socket::Address）。 ","excerpt":"上游一般通过命名服务发现所有的下游节点，并通过多种负载均衡方法把流量分配给下游节点。当下游节点出现问题时，它可能会被隔离以提高负载均衡的效率。被隔离的节点定期被健康检查，成功后重新加入正常节点。\n命名 …","ref":"https://brpc.incubator.apache.org/docs/rpc-in-depth/load-balancing/","title":"Load Balancing"},{"body":"parallel_http能同时访问大量的http服务（几万个），适合在命令行中查询线上所有server的内置信息，供其他工具进一步过滤和聚合。curl很难做到这点，即使多个curl以后台的方式运行，并行度一般也只有百左右，访问几万台机器需要等待极长的时间。\n","excerpt":"parallel_http能同时访问大量的http服务（几万个），适合在命令行中查询线上所有server的内置信息，供其他工具进一步过滤和聚合。curl很难做到这点，即使多个curl以后台的方式运行， …","ref":"https://brpc.incubator.apache.org/docs/tools/parallel_http/","title":"parallel_http"},{"body":"ub是百度内广泛使用的老RPC框架，在迁移ub服务时不可避免地需要访问ub-server或被ub-client访问。ub使用的协议种类很多，但都以nshead作为二进制包的头部，这类服务在brpc中统称为\u0026quot;nshead service\u0026quot;。\nnshead后大都使用mcpack/compack作为序列化格式，注意这不是“协议”。\u0026ldquo;协议\u0026quot;除了序列化格式，还涉及到各种特殊字段的定义，一种序列化格式可能会衍生出很多协议。ub没有定义标准协议，所以即使都使用mcpack或compack，产品线的通信协议也是五花八门，无法互通。鉴于此，我们提供了一套接口，让用户能够灵活的处理自己产品线的协议，同时享受brpc提供的builtin services等一系列框架福利。\n使用ubrpc的服务 ubrpc协议的基本形式是nshead+compack或mcpack2，但compack或mcpack2中包含一些RPC过程需要的特殊字段。\n在brpc r31687之后，用protobuf写的服务可以通过mcpack2pb被ubrpc client访问，步骤如下：\n把idl文件转化为proto文件 使用脚本idl2proto把idl文件自动转化为proto文件，下面是转化后的proto文件。\n// Converted from echo.idl by brpc/tools/idl2proto import \u0026#34;idl_options.proto\u0026#34;;

Call ParseRequestFromIOBuf() to convert the body after nshead header to pb request, then call the pb method. When user calls server\u0026rsquo;s done to end the RPC, SerializeResponseToIOBuf() is called to convert pb response to binary data that will be appended after nshead header and sent back to client. 这样做的好处是，这个服务还可以被其他使用protobuf的协议访问，比如baidu_std，hulu_pbrpc，sofa_pbrpc协议等等。NsheadPbServiceAdaptor的主要接口如下。完整的example在这里。\nclass NsheadPbServiceAdaptor : public NsheadService { public: NsheadPbServiceAdaptor() : NsheadService( NsheadServiceOptions(false, SendNsheadPbResponseSize)) {} virtual ~NsheadPbServiceAdaptor() {} // Fetch meta from `nshead_req\u0026#39; into `meta\u0026#39;. // Params: // server: where the RPC runs. // nshead_req: the nshead request that server received. // controller: If something goes wrong, call controller-\u0026gt;SetFailed() // meta: Set meta information into this structure. `full_method_name\u0026#39; // must be set if controller is not SetFailed()-ed // FIXME: server is not needed anymore, controller-\u0026gt;server() is same virtual void ParseNsheadMeta(const Server\u0026amp; server, const NsheadMessage\u0026amp; nshead_req, Controller* controller, NsheadMeta* meta) const = 0; // Transform `nshead_req\u0026#39; to `pb_req\u0026#39;. // Params: // meta: was set by ParseNsheadMeta() // nshead_req: the nshead request that server received. // controller: you can set attachment into the controller.

or \u0026ldquo;random\u0026rdquo;: \u0026ldquo;la\u0026rdquo; : 真实的场景中不会有这么显著的差异，但你应该能看到差别了。\n这有很多应用场景：\n如果本机有下游服务，LALB会优先访问这些最近的节点。比如CTR应用中有一个计算在1ms左右的receiver模块，被model模块访问，很多model和receiver是同机部署的，以前的分流算法必须走网络，使得receiver的延时开销较大(3-5ms)，特别是在晚上由于离线任务起来，很不稳定，失败率偏高，而LALB会优先访问本机或最近的receiver模块，很多流量都不走网络了，成功率一下子提升了很多。 如果同rack有下游服务，LALB也会优先访问，减少机房核心路由器的压力。甚至不同机房的服务可能不再需要隔离，LALB会优先走本机房的下游，当本机房下游出问题时再自动访问另一些机房。 但我们也不能仅看到“基本原理”，这个算法有它复杂的一面：\n传统的经验告诉我们，不能把所有鸡蛋放一个篮子里，而按延时优化不可避免地会把很多流量送到同一个节点，如果这个节点出问题了，我们如何尽快知道并绕开它。 对吞吐和延时的统计都需要统计窗口，窗口越大数据越可信，噪声越少，但反应也慢了，一个异常的请求可能对统计值造不成什么影响，等我们看到统计值有显著变化时可能已经太晚了。 我们也不能只统计已经回来的，还得盯着路上的请求，否则我们可能会向一个已经出问题（总是不回）的节点傻傻地浪费请求。 ”按权值分流”听上去好简单，但你能写出多线程和可能修改节点的前提下，在O(logN)时间内尽量不互斥的查找算法吗？ 这些问题可以归纳为以下几个方面。\nDoublyBufferedData LoadBalancer是一个读远多于写的数据结构：大部分时候，所有线程从一个不变的server列表中选取一台server。如果server列表真是“不变的”，那么选取server的过程就不用加锁，我们可以写更复杂的分流算法。一个方法是用读写锁，但当读临界区不是特别大时（毫秒级），读写锁并不比mutex快，而实用的分流算法不可能到毫秒级，否则开销也太大了。另一个方法是双缓冲，很多检索端用类似的方法实现无锁的查找过程，它大概这么工作：\n数据分前台和后台。 检索线程只读前台，不用加锁。 只有一个写线程：修改后台数据，切换前后台，睡眠一段时间，以确保老前台（新后台）不再被检索线程访问。 这个方法的问题在于它假定睡眠一段时间后就能避免和前台读线程发生竞争，这个时间一般是若干秒。由于多次写之间有间隔，这儿的写往往是批量写入，睡眠时正好用于积累数据增量。\n但这套机制对“server列表”不太好用：总不能插入一个server就得等几秒钟才能插入下一个吧，即使我们用批量插入，这个\u0026quot;冷却\u0026quot;间隔多少会让用户觉得疑惑：短了担心安全性，长了觉得没有必要。我们能尽量降低这个时间并使其安全么？\n我们需要写以某种形式和读同步，但读之间相互没竞争。一种解法是，读拿一把thread-local锁，写需要拿到所有的thread-local锁。具体过程如下：\n数据分前台和后台。 读拿到自己所在线程的thread-local锁，执行查询逻辑后释放锁。 同时只有一个写：修改后台数据，切换前后台，挨个获得所有thread-local锁并立刻释放，结束后再改一遍新后台（老前台）。 我们来分析下这个方法的基本原理：\n当一个读正在发生时，它会拿着所在线程的thread-local锁，这把锁会挡住同时进行的写，从而保证前台数据不会被修改。 在大部分时候thread-local锁都没有竞争，对性能影响很小。 逐个获取thread-local锁并立刻释放是为了确保对应的读线程看到了切换后的新前台。如果所有的读线程都看到了新前台，写线程便可以安全地修改老前台（新后台）了。 其他特点：\n不同的读之间没有竞争，高度并发。 如果没有写，读总是能无竞争地获取和释放thread-local锁，一般小于25ns，对延时基本无影响。如果有写，由于其临界区极小（拿到立刻释放），读在大部分时候仍能快速地获得锁，少数时候释放锁时可能有唤醒写线程的代价。由于写本身就是少数情况，读整体上几乎不会碰到竞争锁。 完成这些功能的数据结构是DoublyBufferedData\u0026lt;\u0026gt;，我们常简称为DBD。brpc中的所有load balancer都使用了这个数据结构，使不同线程在分流时几乎不会互斥。而其他rpc实现往往使用了全局锁，这使得它们无法写出复杂的分流算法：否则分流代码将会成为竞争热点。\n这个结构有广泛的应用场景：\nreload词典。大部分时候词典都是只读的，不同线程同时查询时不应互斥。 可替换的全局callback。像butil/logging.cpp支持配置全局LogSink以重定向日志，这个LogSink就是一个带状态的callback。如果只是简单的全局变量，在替换后我们无法直接删除LogSink，因为可能还有都写线程在用。用DBD可以解决这个问题。 weight tree LALB的查找过程是按权值分流，O(N)方法如下：获得所有权值的和total，产生一个间于[0, total-1]的随机数R，逐个遍历权值，直到当前权值之和不大于R，而下一个权值之和大于R。\n这个方法可以工作，也好理解，但当N达到几百时性能已经很差，这儿的主要因素是cache一致性：LALB是一个基于反馈的算法，RPC结束时信息会被反馈入LALB，被遍历的数据结构也一直在被修改。这意味着前台的O(N)读必须刷新每一行cacheline。当N达到数百时，一次查找过程可能会耗时百微秒，更别提更大的N了，LALB（将）作为brpc的默认分流算法，这个性能开销是无法接受的。\n另一个办法是用完全二叉树。每个节点记录了左子树的权值之和，这样我们就能在O(logN)时间内完成查找。当N为1024时，我们最多跳转10次内存，总耗时可控制在1微秒内，这个性能是可接受的。这个方法的难点是如何和DoublyBufferedData结合。\n我们不考虑不使用DoublyBufferedData，那样要么绕不开锁，要么写不出正确的算法。 前台后必须共享权值数据，否则切换前后台时，前台积累的权值数据没法同步到后台。 “左子树权值之和”也被前后台共享，但和权值数据不同，它和位置绑定。比如权值结构的指针可能从位置10移动到位置5，但“左子树权值之和”的指针不会移动，算法需要从原位置减掉差值，而向新位置加上差值。 我们不追求一致性，只要最终一致即可，这能让我们少加锁。这也意味着“权值之和”，“左子树权值之和”，“节点权值”未必能精确吻合，查找算法要能适应这一点。 最困难的部分是增加和删除节点，它们需要在整体上对前台查找不造成什么影响，详细过程请参考代码。\nbase_weight QPS和latency使用一个循环队列统计，默认容量128。我们可以使用这么小的统计窗口，是因为inflight delay能及时纠正过度反应，而128也具备了一定的统计可信度。不过，这么计算latency的缺点是：如果server的性能出现很大的变化，那么我们需要积累一段时间才能看到平均延时的变化。就像上节例子中那样，server反转延时后client需要积累很多秒的数据才能看到的平均延时的变化。目前我们并么有处理这个问题，因为真实生产环境中的server不太会像例子中那样跳变延时，大都是缓缓变慢。当集群有几百台机器时，即使我们反应慢点给个别机器少分流点也不会导致什么问题。如果在产品线中确实出现了性能跳变，并且集群规模不大，我们再处理这个问题。\n权值的计算方法是base_weight = QPS * WEIGHT_SCALE / latency ^ p。其中WEIGHT_SCALE是一个放大系数，为了能用整数存储权值，又能让权值有足够的精度，类似定点数。p默认为2，延时的收敛速度大约为p=1时的p倍，选项quadratic_latency=false可使p=1。\n权值计算在各个环节都有最小值限制，为了防止某个节点的权值过低而使其完全没有访问机会。即使一些延时远大于平均延时的节点，也应该有足够的权值，以确保它们可以被定期访问，否则即使它们变快了，我们也不会知道。\n除了待删除节点，所有节点的权值绝对不会为0。\n这也制造了一个问题：即使一个server非常缓慢（但没有断开连接），它的权值也不会为0，所以总会有一些请求被定期送过去而铁定超时。当qps不高时，为了降低影响面，探测间隔必须拉长。比如为了把对qps=1000的影响控制在1%%内，故障server的权值必须低至使其探测间隔为10秒以上，这降低了我们发现server变快的速度。这个问题的解决方法有：\n什么都不干。这个问题也许没有想象中那么严重，由于持续的资源监控，线上服务很少出现“非常缓慢”的情况，一般性的变慢并不会导致请求超时。 保存一些曾经发向缓慢server的请求，用这些请求探测。这个办法的好处是不浪费请求。但实现起来耦合很多，比较麻烦。 强制backup request。 再选一次。 inflight delay 我们必须追踪还未结束的RPC，否则我们就必须等待到超时或其他错误发生，而这可能会很慢（超时一般会是正常延时的若干倍），在这段时间内我们可能做出了很多错误的分流。最简单的方法是统计未结束RPC的耗时：\n选择server时累加发出时间和未结束次数。 反馈时扣除发出时间和未结束次数。 框架保证每个选择总对应一次反馈。 这样“当前时间 - 发出时间之和 / 未结束次数”便是未结束RPC的平均耗时，我们称之为inflight delay。当inflight delay大于平均延时时，我们就线性地惩罚节点权值，即weight = base_weight * avg_latency / inflight_delay。当发向一个节点的请求没有在平均延时内回来时，它的权值就会很快下降，从而纠正我们的行为，这比等待超时快多了。不过这没有考虑延时的正常抖动，我们还得有方差，方差可以来自统计，也可简单线性于平均延时。不管怎样，有了方差bound后，当inflight delay \u0026gt; avg_latency + max(bound * 3, MIN_BOUND)时才会惩罚权值。3是正态分布中的经验数值。\n","excerpt":"概述 LALB全称Locality-aware load balancing，是一个能把请求及时、自动地送到延时最低的下游的负载均衡算法，特别适合混合部署环境。该算法产生自DP系统，现已加入brpc！ …","ref":"https://brpc.incubator.apache.org/docs/rpc-in-depth/locality-aware/","title":"Locality-aware"},{"body":"用户能通过/rpcz看到最近请求的详细信息，并可以插入注释（annotation），不同于tracing system（如dapper）以全局视角看到整体系统的延时分布，rpcz更多是一个调试工具，虽然角色有所不同，但在brpc中rpcz和tracing的数据来源是一样的。当每秒请求数小于1万时，rpcz会记录所有的请求，超过1万时，rpcz会随机忽略一些请求把采样数控制在1万左右。rpcz可以淘汰时间窗口之前的数据，通过-span_keeping_seconds选项设置，默认1小时。一个长期运行的例子。\n关于开销：我们的实现完全规避了线程竞争，开销极小，在qps 30万的测试场景中，观察不到明显的性能变化，对大部分应用而言应该是“free”的。即使采集了几千万条请求，rpcz也不会增加很多内存，一般在50兆以内。rpcz会占用一些磁盘空间（就像日志一样），如果设定为存一个小时的数据，一般在几百兆左右。\n开关方法 默认不开启，加入-enable_rpcz选项会在启动后开启。\nName Value Description Defined At enable_rpcz (R) true (default:false) Turn on rpcz src/baidu/rpc/builtin/rpcz_service.cpp rpcz_hex_log_id (R) false Show log_id in hexadecimal src/baidu/rpc/builtin/rpcz_service.cpp rpcz_database_dir ./rpc_data/rpcz For storing requests/contexts collected by rpcz. src/baidu/rpc/span.cpp rpcz_keep_span_db false Don\u0026rsquo;t remove DB of rpcz at program\u0026rsquo;s exit src/baidu/rpc/span.cpp rpcz_keep_span_seconds (R) 3600 Keep spans for at most so many seconds src/baidu/rpc/span.cpp 若启动时未加-enable_rpcz，则可在启动后访问SERVER_URL/rpcz/enable动态开启rpcz，访问SERVER_URL/rpcz/disable则关闭，这两个链接等价于访问SERVER_URL/flags/enable_rpcz?setvalue=true和SERVER_URL/flags/enable_rpcz?setvalue=false。在r31010之后，rpc在html版本中增加了一个按钮可视化地开启和关闭。\n如果只是brpc client或没有使用brpc，看这里。\n数据展现 /rpcz展现的数据分为两层。\n第一层 看到最新请求的概况，点击链接进入第二层。\n第二层 看到某系列(trace)或某个请求(span)的详细信息。一般通过点击链接进入，也可以把trace=和span=作为query-string拼出链接\n内容说明：\n时间分为了绝对时间（如2015/01/21-20:20:30.817392，小数点后精确到微秒）和前一个时间的差值（如. 19，代表19微秒)。 trace=ID有点像“session id”，对应一个系统中完成一次对外服务牵涉到的所有服务，即上下游server都共用一个trace-id。span=ID对应一个server或client中一个请求的处理过程。trace-id和span-id在概率上唯一。 第一层页面中的request=和response=后的是数据包的字节数，包括附件但不包括协议meta。第二层中request和response的字节数一般在括号里，比如\u0026quot;Responded(13)\u0026ldquo;中的13。 点击链接可能会访问其他server上的rpcz，点浏览器后退一般会返回到之前的页面位置。 I\u0026rsquo;m the last call, I\u0026rsquo;m about to \u0026hellip;都是用户的annotation。 Annotation 只要你使用了brpc，就可以使用TRACEPRINTF打印内容到事件流中，比如：\nTRACEPRINTF(\u0026#34;Hello rpcz %d\u0026#34;, 123);

refers to is: server sends a message to client after occurrence of an event, rather than passively replying the client as in ordinary RPCs. Following two methods are recommended to implement server push in brpc.\nRemote event Similar to local event, remote event is divided into two steps: registration and notification. The client sends an asynchronous RPC to the server for registration, and puts the event-handling code in the RPC callback. The RPC is also a part of the waiting for the notification, namely the server does not respond directly after receiving the request, instead it does not call done-\u0026gt;Run() (to notify the client) until the local event triggers. As we see, the server is also asynchronous. If the connection is broken during the process, the client fails soon and may choose to retry another server or end the RPC. Server should be aware of the disconnection by using Controller.NotifyOnCancel() and delete useless done in-time.\nThis pattern is similar to long polling in some sense, sounds old but probably still be the most effective method. At first glance \u0026ldquo;server push\u0026rdquo; is server visiting client, opposite with ordinary client visiting server. But do you notice that, the response sent from server back to client is also in the opposite direction of \u0026ldquo;client visiting server\u0026rdquo;? In order to understand differences between response and push, let\u0026rsquo;s analyze the process with the presumption that \u0026ldquo;client may receive messages from the server at any time\u0026rdquo;.\nClient has to understand the messages from server anyway, otherwise the messaging is pointless. Client also needs to know how to deal with the message. If the client does not have the handling code, the message is still useless. In other words, the client should \u0026ldquo;be prepared\u0026rdquo; to the messages from the server, and the \u0026ldquo;preparation\u0026rdquo; often relies on programming contexts that client just faces. Regarding different factors, it\u0026rsquo;s more universal for client to inform server for \u0026ldquo;I am ready\u0026rdquo; (registered) first, then the server notifies the client with events later, in which case the \u0026ldquo;push\u0026rdquo; is just a \u0026ldquo;response\u0026rdquo;, with a very long or even infinite timeout.\nIn some scenarios, the registration can be ignored, such as the push promise in http2, which does not require the web browser(client) to register with the server, because both client and server know that the task between them is to let the client download necessary resources ASAP. Since each resource has a unique URI, the server can directly push resources and URI to the client, which caches the resources to avoid repeated accesses. Similarly, protocols capable of \u0026ldquo;two-way communication\u0026rdquo; probably improves efficiencies of pushing in given scenarios such as multimedia streaming or fixed-format key/value pairs etc, rather than implementing universal pushing. The client knows how to handle messages that may be pushed by servers, so extra registrations are not required. The push can still be treated as a \u0026ldquo;response\u0026rdquo;: to the request that client already and always promised server.\nRestful callback The client wants a given URL to be called with necessary parameters when the event occurs. In this pattern, server can reply the client directly when it receives the registration request, because the event is not triggered by the end of the RPC. In addition, since the callback is just a URL, which can be stored in databases and message queues, this pattern is very flexible and widely used in business systems.\nURL and parameters must contain enough information to make the callback know that which notification corresponds to which request, because the client may care about more than one event at the same time, or an event may be registered more than once due to network jitter or restarting machines etc. If the URL path is fixed, the client should place an unique ID in the registration request and the server should put the ID unchanged in response. Or the client generates an unique path for each registration so that each request is distinguishable from each other naturally. These methods are actually same in essense, just different positions for unique identifiers.\nCallbacks should deal with idempotence. The server may retry and send more than one notifications after encountering network problems. If the first notification has been successful, follow-up notifications should not have effects. The \u0026ldquo;remote event\u0026rdquo; pattern guarantees idempotency at the layer of RPC, which ensures that the done is called once and only once.\nIn order to avoid missing important notifications, users often need to combine RPC and message queues flexibly. RPC is much better at latency and efficiency than message queue, but due to limited memory, server needs to stop sending RPC after several failed retries and do more important things with the memory. It\u0026rsquo;s better to move the notification task into a persistent message queue at the moment, which is capable of retrying during a very long time. With the idempotence in URL callback, most notifications are sent reliably and in-time.\n","excerpt":"Server push What \u0026ldquo;server push\u0026rdquo; refers to is: server sends a message to client after …","ref":"https://brpc.incubator.apache.org/docs/server/server-push/","title":"Server push"},{"body":"","excerpt":"","ref":"https://brpc.incubator.apache.org/docs/tools/","title":"Tools"},{"body":"brpc可通过多种方式访问用ub搭建的服务。\nubrpc (by protobuf) r31687后，brpc支持通过protobuf访问ubrpc，不需要baidu-rpc-ub，也不依赖idl-compiler。（也可以让protobuf服务被ubrpc client访问，方法见使用ubrpc的服务）。\n步骤：\n用idl2proto把idl文件转化为proto文件，老版本idl2proto不会转化idl中的service，需要手动转化。\n// Converted from echo.idl by brpc/tools/idl2proto import \u0026#34;idl_options.proto\u0026#34;; option (idl_support) = true; option cc_generic_services = true; message EchoRequest { required string message = 1; } message EchoResponse { required string message = 1; } // 对于idl中多个request或response的方法，要建立一个包含所有request或response的消息。 // 这个例子中就是MultiRequests和MultiResponses。 message MultiRequests { required EchoRequest req1 = 1; required EchoRequest req2 = 2; } message MultiResponses { required EchoRequest res1 = 1; required EchoRequest res2 = 2; } service EchoService { // 对应idl中的void Echo(EchoRequest req, out EchoResponse res); rpc Echo(EchoRequest) returns (EchoResponse); // 对应idl中的uint32_t EchoWithMultiArgs(EchoRequest req1, EchoRequest req2, out EchoResponse res1, out EchoResponse res2); rpc EchoWithMultiArgs(MultiRequests) returns (MultiResponses); } 原先的echo.idl文件：\nstruct EchoRequest { string message; }; struct EchoResponse { string message; }; service EchoService { void Echo(EchoRequest req, out EchoResponse res); uint32_t EchoWithMultiArgs(EchoRequest req1, EchoRequest req2, out EchoResponse res1, out EchoResponse res2); }; 插入如下片段以使用代码生成插件。\nBRPC_PATH代表brpc产出的路径（包含bin include等目录），PROTOBUF_INCLUDE_PATH代表protobuf的包含路径。注意\u0026ndash;mcpack_out要和\u0026ndash;cpp_out一致。\nprotoc --plugin=protoc-gen-mcpack=$BRPC_PATH/bin/protoc-gen-mcpack --cpp_out=. --mcpack_out=. --proto_path=$BRPC_PATH/include --proto_path=PROTOBUF_INCLUDE_PATH 用channel发起访问。\nidl不同于pb，允许有多个请求，我们先看只有一个请求的情况，和普通的pb访问基本上是一样的。\n#include \u0026lt;brpc/channel.h\u0026gt; #include \u0026#34;echo.pb.h\u0026#34; ... brpc::Channel channel; brpc::ChannelOptions opt; opt.protocol = brpc::PROTOCOL_UBRPC_COMPACK; // or \u0026#34;ubrpc_compack\u0026#34;; if (channel.Init(..., \u0026amp;opt) != 0) { LOG(ERROR) \u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0026#34;Fail to init channel\u0026#34;; return -1; } EchoService_Stub stub(\u0026amp;channel); ...

A处的client会继续超时 -\u0026gt; A继续重试 -\u0026gt; B继续无法恢复。 A或B没有限制某个缓冲或队列的长度，或限制过于宽松。拥塞请求会大量地积压在那里，要恢复就得全部处理完，时间可能长得无法接受。由于有限长的缓冲或队列需要在填满时解决等待、唤醒等问题，有时为了简单，代码可能会假定缓冲或队列不会满，这就埋下了种子。即使队列是有限长的，恢复时间也可能很长，因为清空队列的过程是个追赶问题，排空的时间取决于积压的请求数 / (最大qps - 当前qps)，如果当前qps和最大qps差的不多，积压的请求又比较多，那排空时间就遥遥无期了。 了解这些因素后可以更好的理解brpc中相关的设计。\n拥塞时A服务最大qps的跳变是因为线程个数是硬限，单个请求的处理时间很大程度上决定了最大qps。而brpc server端默认在bthread中处理请求，个数是软限，单个请求超时只是阻塞所在的bthread，并不会影响为新请求建立新的bthread。brpc也提供了完整的异步接口，让用户可以进一步提高io-bound服务的并发度，降低服务被打满的可能性。 brpc中重试默认只在连接出错时发起，避免了流量放大，这是比较有效率的重试方式。如果需要基于超时重试，可以设置backup request，这类重试最多只有一次，放大程度降到了最低。brpc中的RPC超时是deadline，超过后RPC一定会结束，这让用户对服务的行为有更好的预判。在之前的一些实现中，RPC超时是单次超时*重试次数，在实践中容易误判。 brpc server端的max_concurrency选项控制了server的最大并发：当同时处理的请求数超过max_concurrency时，server会回复client错误，而不是继续积压。这一方面在服务开始的源头控制住了积压的请求数，尽量避免延生到用户缓冲或队列中，另一方面也让client尽快地去重试其他server，对集群来说是个更好的策略。 对于brpc的用户来说，要防止雪崩，主要注意两点：\n评估server的最大并发，设置合理的max_concurrency值。这个默认是不设的，也就是不限制。无论程序是同步还是异步，用户都可以通过 最大qps * 非拥塞时的延时（秒）来评估最大并发，原理见little\u0026rsquo;s law，这两个量都可以在brpc中的内置服务中看到。max_concurrency与最大并发相等或大一些就行了。 注意考察重试发生时的行为，特别是在定制RetryPolicy时。如果你只是用默认的brpc重试，一般是安全的。但用户程序也常会自己做重试，比如通过一个Channel访问失败后，去访问另外一个Channel，这种情况下要想清楚重试发生时最差情况下请求量会放大几倍，服务是否可承受。 ","excerpt":"“雪崩”指的是访问服务集群时绝大部分请求都超时，且在流量减少时仍无法恢复的现象。下面解释这个现象的来源。\n当流量超出服务的最大qps时，服务将无法正常服务；当流量恢复正常时（小于服务的处理能力），积压 …","ref":"https://brpc.incubator.apache.org/docs/server/avalanche/","title":"Avalanche"},{"body":"","excerpt":"","ref":"https://brpc.incubator.apache.org/docs/c++-base/","title":"C++ Base"},{"body":"概述 一些场景希望同样的请求尽量落到一台机器上，比如访问缓存集群时，我们往往希望同一种请求能落到同一个后端上，以充分利用其上已有的缓存，不同的机器承载不同的稳定working set。而不是随机地散落到所有机器上，那样的话会迫使所有机器缓存所有的内容，最终由于存不下形成颠簸而表现糟糕。 我们都知道hash能满足这个要求，比如当有n台服务器时，输入x总是会发送到第hash(x) % n台服务器上。但当服务器变为m台时，hash(x) % n和hash(x) % m很可能都不相等，这会使得几乎所有请求的发送目的地都发生变化，如果目的地是缓存服务，所有缓存将失效，继而对原本被缓存遮挡的数据库或计算服务造成请求风暴，触发雪崩。一致性哈希是一种特殊的哈希算法，在增加服务器时，发向每个老节点的请求中只会有一部分转向新节点，从而实现平滑的迁移。这篇论文中提出了一致性hash的概念。\n一致性hash满足以下四个性质：\n平衡性 (Balance) : 每个节点被选到的概率是O(1/n)。 单调性 (Monotonicity) : 当新节点加入时， 不会有请求在老节点间移动， 只会从老节点移动到新节点。当有节点被删除时，也不会影响落在别的节点上的请求。 分散性 (Spread) : 当上游的机器看到不同的下游列表时(在上线时及不稳定的网络中比较常见), 同一个请求尽量映射到少量的节点中。 负载 (Load) : 当上游的机器看到不同的下游列表的时候， 保证每台下游分到的请求数量尽量一致。 实现方式 所有server的32位hash值在32位整数值域上构成一个环(Hash Ring)，环上的每个区间和一个server唯一对应，如果一个key落在某个区间内， 它就被分流到对应的server上。\n当删除一个server的，它对应的区间会归属于相邻的server，所有的请求都会跑过去。当增加一个server时，它会分割某个server的区间并承载落在这个区间上的所有请求。单纯使用Hash Ring很难满足我们上节提到的属性，主要两个问题：\n在机器数量较少的时候， 区间大小会不平衡。 当一台机器故障的时候， 它的压力会完全转移到另外一台机器， 可能无法承载。 为了解决这个问题，我们为每个server计算m个hash值，从而把32位整数值域划分为n*m个区间，当key落到某个区间时，分流到对应的server上。那些额外的hash值使得区间划分更加均匀，被称为虚拟节点（Virtual Node）。当删除一个server时，它对应的m个区间会分别合入相邻的区间中，那个server上的请求会较为平均地转移到其他server上。当增加server时，它会分割m个现有区间，从对应server上分别转移一些请求过来。\n由于节点故障和变化不常发生，我们选择了修改复杂度为O(n)的有序数组来存储hash ring，每次分流使用二分查找来选择对应的机器，由于存储是连续的，查找效率比基于平衡二叉树的实现高。线程安全性请参照Double Buffered Data章节.\n使用方式 我们内置了分别基于murmurhash3和md5两种hash算法的实现，使用要做两件事：\n在Channel.Init 时指定load_balancer_name为 \u0026ldquo;c_murmurhash\u0026rdquo; 或 \u0026ldquo;c_md5\u0026rdquo;。 发起rpc时通过Controller::set_request_code(uint64_t)填入请求的hash code。 request的hash算法并不需要和lb的hash算法保持一致，只需要hash的值域是32位无符号整数。由于memcache默认使用md5，访问memcached集群时请选择c_md5保证兼容性，其他场景可以选择c_murmurhash以获得更高的性能和更均匀的分布。\n虚拟节点个数 通过-chash_num_replicas可设置默认的虚拟节点个数，默认值为100。对于某些特殊场合，对虚拟节点个数有自定义的需求，可以通过将load_balancer_name加上参数replicas=配置，如：\nchannel.Init(\u0026#34;http://...\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;c_murmurhash:replicas=150\u0026#34;, \u0026amp;options);

Apparently the worker threads are enough.\nThese two figures can be seen directly by putting /vars/bthread_worker_count;bthread_worker_usage?expand after service url, just like this.\n2. Check CPU usage Check /vars/system_core_count and /vars/process_cpu_usage, which is the number of cpu core available and being used, respectively.\nThe number of usage and count being close means that cpus are enough.\nIn the following figure the number of cores is 24, while the number of cores being used is 20.9, which means CPU is bottleneck.\nThe number of cores being used in the figure below is 2.06, then CPU is sufficient.\n3. Locate problems The number of process_cpu_usage being close to bthread_worker_usage means it is a cpu-bound program and worker threads are doing calculations in most of the time.\nThe number of process_cpu_usage being much less than bthread_worker_usage means it is an io-bound program and worker threads are blocking in most of the time.\n(1 - process_cpu_usage / bthread_worker_usage) is the time ratio that spent on blocking. For example, if process_cpu_usage = 2.4, bthread_worker_usage = 18.5, then worker threads spent 87.1% of time on blocking.\n3.1 Locate cpu-bound problem The possible reason may be the poor performance of single server or uneven distribution to upstreams.\nexclude the suspect of uneven distribution to upstreams Enter qps at [vars]((http://brpc.baidu.com:8765/vars) page of different services to check whether qps is as expected, just like this:\nOr directly visit using curl in command line, like this:\n$ curl brpc.baidu.com:8765/vars/*qps* bthread_creation_qps : 95 rpc_server_8765_example_echo_service_echo_qps : 57 If the distribution of different machines is indeed uneven and difficult to solve, Limit concurrency can be considered to use.\nImprove performance of single server Please use CPU profiler to analyze hot spots of the program and use data to guide optimization. Generally speaking, some big and obvious hot spots can be found in a cpu-bound program.\n3.2 Locate io-bound problem The possible reason:\nworking threads are not enough. the client that visits downstream servers doesn\u0026rsquo;t support bthread and the latency is too long. blocking that caused by internal locks, IO, etc. If blocking is inevitable, please consider asynchronous method.\nexclude the suspect of working threads are not enough If working threads are not enough, you can try to dynamically adjust the number of threads. Switch to the /flags page and click the (R) in the right of bthread_concurrency:\nJust enter the new thread number and confirm:\nBack to the /flags page, you can see that bthread_concurrency has become the new value.\nHowever, adjusting the number of threads may not be useful. If the worker threads are largely blocked by visiting downstreams, it is useless to adjust the thread number since the real bottleneck is in the back-end and adjusting the thread number to a larger value just make the blocking time of each thread become longer.\nFor example, in our example, the worker threads are still full of work after the thread number is resized.\nexclude the suspect of lock If the program is blocked by some lock, it can also present features of io-bound. First use contention profiler to check the contention status of locks.\nuse rpcz rpcz can help you see all the recent requests and the time(us) spent in each phase while processing them.\nClick on a span link to see when the RPC started, the spent time in each phase and when it ended.\nThis is a typical example that server is blocked severely. It takes 20ms from receiving the request to starting running, indicating that the server does not have enough worker threads to get the job done in time.\nFor now the information of this span is less, we can add some in the program. You can use TRACEPRINTF print logs to rpcz. Printed content is embedded in the time stream of rpcz.\nAfter Re-running, you can check the span and it really contains the content we added by TRACEPRINTF.\nBefore running to the first TRACEPRINTF, the user callback has already run for 2051ms(suppose it meets our expectation), followed by foobar() that took 8036ms, which is expected to return very fast. The range has been further reduced.\nRepeat this process until you find the function that caused the problem.\nUse bvar TRACEPRINTF is mainly suitable for functions that called several times, so if a function is called many times, or the function itself has a small overhead, it is not appropriate to print logs to rpcz every time. You can use bvar instead.\nbvar is a multi-threaded counting library, which can record the value passed from user at an extreme low cost and almost does not affect the program behavior compared to logging.\nFollow the code below to monitor the runtime of foobar.\n#include \u0026lt;butil/time.h\u0026gt; #include \u0026lt;bvar/bvar.h\u0026gt; bvar::LatencyRecorder g_foobar_latency(\u0026#34;foobar\u0026#34;); ... void search() { ... butil::Timer tm; tm.start(); foobar(); tm.stop(); g_foobar_latency \u0026lt;\u0026lt; tm.u_elapsed(); ... } After rerunning the program, enter foobar in the search box of vars. The result is shown as below:\nClick on a bvar and you can see a dynamic figure. For example, after clicking on cdf:\nDepending on the distribution of delays, you can infer the overall behavior of this function, how it behaves for most requests and how it behaves for long tails.\nYou can continue this process in the subroutine, add more bvar, compare the different distributions, and finally locate the source.\nUse brpc client only You have to open the dummy server to provide built-in services, see here.\n","excerpt":"1.

Compared to memcached it provides users with more data structures and operations, speeding up developments. In order to access redis servers more conveniently and make full use of bthread\u0026rsquo;s capability of concurrency, brpc directly supports the redis protocol. Check example/redis_c++ for an example.\nAdvantages compared to hiredis (the official redis client):\nThread safety. No need to set up separate clients for each thread. Support synchronous, asynchronous, semi-synchronous accesses etc. Support ParallelChannel etc to define access patterns declaratively. Support various connection types. Support timeout, backup request, cancellation, tracing, built-in services, and other benefits offered by brpc. All brpc clients in a process share a single connection to one redis-server, which is more efficient when multiple threads access one redis-server simultaneously (see performance). Memory is allocated in blocks regardless of complexity of the reply, and short string optimization (SSO) is implemented to further improve performance. Similarly with http, brpc guarantees that the time complexity of parsing redis replies is O(N) in worst cases rather than O(N^2) , where N is the number of bytes of reply. This is important when the reply consists of large arrays.\nTurn on -redis_verbose to print contents of all redis requests and responses, which is for debugging only.\nRequest a redis server Create a Channel for accessing redis:\n#include \u0026lt;brpc/redis.h\u0026gt; #include \u0026lt;brpc/channel.h\u0026gt; brpc::ChannelOptions options; options.protocol = brpc::PROTOCOL_REDIS; brpc::Channel redis_channel; if (redis_channel.Init(\u0026#34;0.0.0.0:6379\u0026#34;, \u0026amp;options) != 0) { // 6379 is the default port for redis-server LOG(ERROR) \u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0026#34;Fail to init channel to redis-server\u0026#34;; return -1; } ...

The callsite backtrace is also printed on error.\nbool AddCommand(const char* fmt, ...); bool AddCommandV(const char* fmt, va_list args); bool AddCommandByComponents(const butil::StringPiece* components, size_t n); Formatting is compatible with hiredis, namely %b corresponds to binary data (pointer + length), others are similar to those in printf. Some improvements have been made such as characters enclosed by single or double quotes are recognized as one field regardless of the spaces inside. For example, AddCommand(\u0026quot;Set 'a key with space' 'a value with space as well'\u0026quot;) sets value a value with space as well to key a key with space, while in hiredis the command must be written as redisvCommand(..., \u0026quot;SET% s% s\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;a key with space\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;a value with space as well\u0026quot;);\nAddCommandByComponents is similar to redisCommandArgv in hiredis. Users specify each part of the command in an array, which is immune to escaping issues often occurring in AddCommand and AddCommandV. If you encounter errors such as \u0026ldquo;Unmatched quote\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;invalid format\u0026rdquo; when using AddCommand and AddCommandV, try this method.\nIf AddCommand* fails, subsequent AddCommand* and CallMethod also fail. In general, there is no need to check return value of AddCommand*, since the RPC fails directly anyway.\nUse command_size() to get number of commands added successfully.\nCall Clear() before re-using the RedisRequest object.\nRedisResponse A RedisResponse may contain one or multiple RedisReplys. Use reply_size() for total number of replies and reply(i) for reference to the i-th reply (counting from 0). Note that in hiredis, if the request contains N commands, you have to call redisGetReply N times to get replies, while it\u0026rsquo;s unnecessary in brpc as the RedisResponse already includes the N replies which are accessible by reply(i). As long as RPC is successful, response.reply_size() should be equal to request.command_size(), unless the redis-server is buggy. The precondition that redis works correctly is that replies correspond to commands one by one in the same sequence (positional correspondence).\nEach RedisReply may be:\nREDIS_REPLY_NIL: NULL in redis, which means value does not exist. Testable by is_nil(). REDIS_REPLY_STATUS: Referred to Simple String in the redis document, usually used as the status of operations, such as the OK returned by SET. Testable by is_string() (same function for REDIS_REPLY_STRING). Use c_str() or data() to get the value. REDIS_REPLY_STRING: Referred to Bulk String in the redis document. Most return values are of this type, including those returned by incr. Testable by is_string(). Use c_str() or data() for the value. REDIS_REPLY_ERROR: The error message for a failed operation. Testable by is_error(). Use error_message() to get the message. REDIS_REPLY_INTEGER: A 64-bit signed integer. Testable by is_integer(). Use integer() to get the value. REDIS_REPLY_ARRAY: Array of replies. Testable by is_array(). Use size() for size of the array and [i] for the reference to the corresponding sub-reply. If a response contains three replies: an integer, a string and an array with 2 items, we can use response.reply(0).integer(), response.reply(1).c_str(), and repsonse.reply(2)[0], repsonse.reply(2)[1] to fetch values respectively. If the type is not correct, backtrace of the callsite is printed and an undefined value is returned.\nOwnership of all replies belongs to RedisResponse. All relies are destroyed when response is destroyed.\nCall Clear() before re-using the RedisRespones object.\nRequest a redis cluster Create a Channel using the consistent hashing as the load balancing algorithm(c_md5 or c_murmurhash) to access a redis cluster mounted under a naming service. Note that each RedisRequest should contain only one command or all commands have the same key. Under current implementation, multiple commands inside a single request are always sent to a same server. If the keys are located on different servers, the result must be wrong. In which case, you have to divide the request into multilple ones with one command each.\nAnother choice is to use the common twemproxy solution, which makes clients access the cluster just like accessing a single server, although the solution needs to deploy proxies and adds more latency.\nDebug Turn on -redis_verbose to print contents of all redis requests and responses. Note that this should only be used for debugging rather than online services.\nTurn on -redis_verbose_crlf2space to replace the CRLF (\\r\\n) with spaces in debugging logs for better readability.\nName Value Description Defined At redis_verbose false [DEBUG] Print EVERY redis request/response src/brpc/policy/redis_protocol.cpp redis_verbose_crlf2space false [DEBUG] Show \\r\\n as a space src/brpc/redis.cpp Performance redis version: 2.6.14\nStart a client to send requests to a redis-server on the same machine using 1, 50, 200 bthreads synchronously.

服务的处理能力是有客观上限的。当请求速度超过服务的处理速度时，服务就会过载。\n如果服务持续过载，会导致越来越多的请求积压，最终所有的请求都必须等待较长时间才能被处理，从而使整个服务处于瘫痪状态。\n与之相对的，如果直接拒绝掉一部分请求，反而能够让服务能够\u0026quot;及时\u0026quot;处理更多的请求。对应的方法就是设置最大并发。\n自适应限流能动态调整服务的最大并发，在保证服务不过载的前提下，让服务尽可能多的处理请求。\n使用场景 通常情况下要让服务不过载，只需在上线前进行压力测试，并通过little\u0026rsquo;s law计算出best_max_concurrency就可以了。但在服务数量多，拓扑复杂，且处理能力会逐渐变化的局面下，使用固定的最大并发会带来巨大的测试工作量，很不方便。自适应限流就是为了解决这个问题。\n使用自适应限流前建议做到：\n客户端开启了重试功能。\n服务端有多个节点。\n这样当一个节点返回过载时，客户端可以向其他的节点发起重试，从而尽量不丢失流量。\n开启方法 目前只有method级别支持自适应限流。如果要为某个method开启自适应限流，只需要将它的最大并发设置为\u0026quot;auto\u0026quot;即可。\n// Set auto concurrency limiter for all methods brpc::ServerOptions options; options.method_max_concurrency =

同时处理的请求数，又被称为“并发度”。\nmax_concurrency: 设置的最大并发度。超过并发的请求会被拒绝（返回ELIMIT错误），在集群层面，client应重试到另一台server上去。\nbest_max_concurrency: 并发的物理含义是任务处理槽位，天然存在上限，这个上限就是best_max_concurrency。若max_concurrency设置的过大，则concurrency可能大于best_max_concurrency，任务将无法被及时处理而暂存在各种队列中排队，系统也会进入拥塞状态。若max_concurrency设置的过小，则concurrency总是会小于best_max_concurrency，限制系统达到本可以达到的更高吞吐。\nnoload_latency: 单纯处理任务的延时，不包括排队时间。另一种解释是低负载的延时。由于正确处理任务得经历必要的环节，其中会耗费cpu或等待下游返回，noload_latency是一个服务固有的属性，但可能随时间逐渐改变（由于内存碎片，压力变化，业务数据变化等因素）。\nmin_latency: 实际测定的latency中的较小值的ema，当concurrency不大于best_max_concurrency时，min_latency和noload_latency接近(可能轻微上升）。\npeak_qps: qps的上限。注意是处理或回复的qps而不是接收的qps。值取决于best_max_concurrency / noload_latency，这两个量都是服务的固有属性，故peak_qps也是服务的固有属性，和拥塞状况无关，但可能随时间逐渐改变。\nmax_qps: 实际测定的qps中的较大值。由于qps具有上限，max_qps总是会小于peak_qps，不论拥塞与否。\nLittle\u0026rsquo;s Law 在服务处于稳定状态时: concurrency = latency * qps。 这是自适应限流的理论基础。\n当服务没有超载时，随着流量的上升，latency基本稳定(接近noload_latency)，qps和concurrency呈线性关系一起上升。\n当流量超过服务的peak_qps时，则concurrency和latency会一起上升，而qps会稳定在peak_qps。\n假如一个服务的peak_qps和noload_latency都比较稳定，那么它的best_max_concurrency = noload_latency * peak_qps。\n自适应限流就是要找到服务的noload_latency和peak_qps， 并将最大并发设置为靠近两者乘积的一个值。\n计算公式 自适应限流会不断的对请求进行采样，当采样窗口的样本数量足够时，会根据样本的平均延迟和服务当前的qps计算出下一个采样窗口的max_concurrency:\nmax_concurrency = max_qps * ((2+alpha) * min_latency - latency)\nalpha为可接受的延时上升幅度，默认0.3。\nlatency是当前采样窗口内所有请求的平均latency。\nmax_qps是最近一段时间测量到的qps的极大值。\nmin_latency是最近一段时间测量到的latency较小值的ema，是noload_latency的估算值。\n当服务处于低负载时，min_latency约等于noload_latency，此时计算出来的max_concurrency会高于concurrency，但低于best_max_concurrency，给流量上涨留探索空间。而当服务过载时，服务的qps约等于max_qps，同时latency开始明显超过min_latency，此时max_concurrency则会接近concurrency，并通过定期衰减避免远离best_max_concurrency，保证服务不会过载。\n估算noload_latency 服务的noload_latency并非是一成不变的，自适应限流必须能够正确的探测noload_latency的变化。当noload_latency下降时，是很容感知到的，因为这个时候latency也会下降。难点在于当latency上涨时，需要能够正确的辨别到底是服务过载了，还是noload_latency上涨了。\n可能的方案有：\n取最近一段时间的最小latency来近似noload_latency 取最近一段时间的latency的各种平均值来预测noload_latency 收集请求的平均排队等待时间，使用latency - queue_time作为noload_latency 每隔一段时间缩小max_concurrency，过一小段时间后以此时的latency作为noload_latency 方案1和方案2的问题在于：假如服务持续处于高负载，那么最近的所有latency都会高出noload_latency，从而使得算法估计的noload_latency不断升高。\n方案3的问题在于，假如服务的性能瓶颈在下游服务，那么请求在服务本身的排队等待时间无法反应整体的负载情况。\n方案4是最通用的，也经过了大量实验的考验。缩小max_concurrency和公式中的alpha存在关联。让我们做个假想实验，若latency极为稳定并都等于min_latency，那么公式简化为max_concurrency = max_qps * latency * (1 + alpha)。根据little\u0026rsquo;s law，qps最多为max_qps * (1 + alpha). alpha是qps的\u0026quot;探索空间\u0026quot;，若alpha为0，则qps被锁定为max_qps，算法可能无法探索到peak_qps。但在qps已经达到peak_qps时，alpha会使延时上升（已拥塞），此时测定的min_latency会大于noload_latency，一轮轮下去最终会导致min_latency不收敛。定期降低max_concurrency就是阻止这个过程，并给min_latency下降提供\u0026quot;探索空间\u0026quot;。\n减少重测时的流量损失 每隔一段时间，自适应限流算法都会缩小max_concurrency，并持续一段时间，然后将此时的latency作为服务的noload_latency，以处理noload_latency上涨了的情况。测量noload_latency时，必须让先服务处于低负载的状态，因此对max_concurrency的缩小是难以避免的。\n由于max_concurrency \u0026lt; concurrency时，服务会拒绝掉所有的请求，限流算法将\u0026quot;排空所有的经历过排队等待的请求的时间\u0026quot; 设置为 latency * 2 ，以确保用于计算min_latency的样本绝大部分都是没有经过排队等待的。\n由于服务的latency通常都不会太长，这种做法所带来的流量损失也很小。\n应对抖动 即使服务自身没有过载，latency也会发生波动，根据Little\u0026rsquo;s Law，latency的波动会导致server的concurrency发生波动。\n我们在设计自适应限流的计算公式时，考虑到了latency发生抖动的情况: 当latency与min_latency很接近时，根据计算公式会得到一个较高max_concurrency来适应concurrency的波动，从而尽可能的减少“误杀”。同时，随着latency的升高，max_concurrency会逐渐降低，以保护服务不会过载。\n从另一个角度来说，当latency也开始升高时，通常意味着某处(不一定是服务本身，也有可能是下游服务)消耗了大量CPU资源，这个时候缩小max_concurrency也是合理的。\n平滑处理 为了减少个别窗口的抖动对限流算法的影响，同时尽量降低计算开销，计算min_latency时会通过使用EMA来进行平滑处理：\nif latency \u0026gt; min_latency: min_latency = latency * ema_alpha + (1 - ema_alpha) * min_latency else: do_nothing 估算peak_qps 提高qps增长的速度 当服务启动时，由于服务本身需要进行一系列的初始化，tcp本身也有慢启动等一系列原因。服务在刚启动时的qps一定会很低。这就导致了服务启动时的max_concurrency也很低。而按照上面的计算公式，当max_concurrency很低的时候，预留给qps增长的冗余concurrency也很低(即：alpha * max_qps * min_latency)。从而会影响当流量增加时，服务max_concurrency的增加速度。\n假如从启动到打满qps的时间过长，这期间会损失大量流量。在这里我们采取的措施有两个，\n采样方面，一旦采到的请求数量足够多，直接提交当前采样窗口，而不是等待采样窗口的到时间了才提交 计算公式方面，当current_qps \u0026gt; 保存的max_qps时，直接进行更新，不进行平滑处理。 在进行了这两个处理之后，绝大部分情况下都能够在2秒左右将qps打满。\n平滑处理 为了减少个别窗口的抖动对限流算法的影响，同时尽量降低计算开销，在计算max_qps时，会通过使用EMA来进行平滑处理：\nif current_qps \u0026gt; max_qps: max_qps = current_qps else: max_qps = current_qps * ema_alpha / 10 + (1 - ema_alpha / 10) * max_qps 将max_qps的ema参数置为min_latency的ema参数的十分之一的原因是: max_qps 下降了通常并不意味着极限qps也下降了。而min_latency下降了，通常意味着noload_latency确实下降了。\n与netflix gradient算法的对比 netflix中的gradient算法公式为：max_concurrency = min_latency / latency * max_concurrency + queue_size。\n其中latency是采样窗口的最小latency，min_latency是最近多个采样窗口的最小latency。min_latency / latency就是算法中的\u0026quot;梯度\u0026quot;，当latency大于min_latency时，max_concurrency会逐渐减少；反之，max_concurrency会逐渐上升，从而让max_concurrency围绕在best_max_concurrency附近。\n这个公式可以和本文的算法进行类比：\ngradient算法中的latency和本算法的不同，前者的latency是最小值，后者是平均值。netflix的原意是最小值能更好地代表noload_latency，但实际上只要不对max_concurrency做定期衰减，不管最小值还是平均值都有可能不断上升使算法不收敛。最小值并不能带来额外的好处，反而会使算法更不稳定。 gradient算法中的max_concurrency / latency从概念上和qps有关联（根据little\u0026rsquo;s law)，但可能严重脱节。比如在重测 min_latency前，若所有latency都小于min_latency，那么max_concurrency会不断下降甚至到0；但按照本算法，max_qps和min_latency仍然是稳定的，它们计算出的max_concurrency也不会剧烈变动。究其本质，gradient算法在迭代max_concurrency时，latency并不能代表实际并发为max_concurrency时的延时，两者是脱节的，所以max_concurrency / latency的实际物理含义不明，与qps可能差异甚大，最后导致了很大的偏差。 gradient算法的queue_size推荐为sqrt(max_concurrency)，这是不合理的。netflix对queue_size的理解大概是代表各种不可控环节的缓存，比如socket里的，和max_concurrency存在一定的正向关系情有可原。但在我们的理解中，这部分queue_size作用微乎其微，没有或用常量即可。我们关注的queue_size是给concurrency上升留出的探索空间: max_concurrency的更新是有延迟的，在并发从低到高的增长过程中，queue_size的作用就是在max_concurrency更新前不限制qps上升。而当concurrency高时，服务可能已经过载了，queue_size就应该小一点，防止进一步恶化延时。这里的queue_size和并发是反向关系。 ","excerpt":"自适应限流

浪费的空间少。如果每个线程各申请各的，速度也许不错，但万一一个线程总是申请，另一个线程总是释放，内存就爆炸了。线程之间总是要共享内存的，如何共享就是方案的关键了。 一般的应用可以使用tcmalloc、jemalloc等成熟的内存分配方案，但这对于较为底层，关注性能长尾的应用是不够的。多线程框架广泛地通过传递对象的ownership来让问题异步化，如何让分配这些小对象的开销变的更小是值得研究的问题。其中的一个特点较为显著：\n大多数结构是等长的。 这个属性可以大幅简化内存分配的过程，获得比通用malloc更稳定、快速的性能。brpc中的ResourcePool和ObjectPool即提供这类分配。\n这篇文章不鼓励用户使用ResourcePool或ObjectPool，事实上我们反对用户在程序中使用这两个类。因为”等长“的副作用是某个类型独占了一部分内存，这些内存无法再被其他类型使用，如果不加控制的滥用，反而会在程序中产生大量彼此隔离的内存分配体系，既浪费内存也不见得会有更好的性能。\nResourcePool 创建一个类型为T的对象并返回一个偏移量，这个偏移量可以在O(1)时间内转换为对象指针。这个偏移量相当于指针，但它的值在一般情况下小于2^32，所以我们可以把它作为64位id的一部分。对象可以被归还，但归还后对象并没有删除，也没有被析构，而是仅仅进入freelist。下次申请时可能会取到这种使用过的对象，需要重置后才能使用。当对象被归还后，通过对应的偏移量仍可以访问到对象，即ResourcePool只负责内存分配，并不解决ABA问题。但对于越界的偏移量，ResourcePool会返回空。\n由于对象等长，ResourcePool通过批量分配和归还内存以避免全局竞争，并降低单次的开销。每个线程的分配流程如下：\n查看thread-local free block。如果还有free的对象，返回。没有的话步骤2。 尝试从全局取一个free block，若取到的话回到步骤1，否则步骤3。 从全局取一个block，返回其中第一个对象。 原理是比较简单的。工程实现上数据结构、原子变量、memory fence等问题会复杂一些。下面以bthread_t的生成过程说明ResourcePool是如何被应用的。\nObjectPool 这是ResourcePool的变种，不返回偏移量，而直接返回对象指针。内部结构和ResourcePool类似，一些代码更加简单。对于用户来说，这就是一个多线程下的对象池，brpc里也是这么用的。比如Socket::Write中把每个待写出的请求包装为WriteRequest，这个对象就是用ObjectPool分配的。\n生成bthread_t 用户期望通过创建bthread获得更高的并发度，所以创建bthread必须很快。 在目前的实现中创建一个bthread的平均耗时小于200ns。如果每次都要从头创建，是不可能这么快的。创建过程更像是从一个bthread池子中取一个实例，我们又同时需要一个id来指代一个bthread，所以这儿正是ResourcePool的用武之地。bthread在代码中被称作Task，其结构被称为TaskMeta，定义在task_meta.h中，所有的TaskMeta由ResourcePool分配。\nbthread的大部分函数都需要在O(1)时间内通过bthread_t访问到TaskMeta，并且当bthread_t失效后，访问应返回NULL以让函数做出返回错误。解决方法是：bthread_t由32位的版本和32位的偏移量组成。版本解决ABA问题，偏移量由ResourcePool分配。查找时先通过偏移量获得TaskMeta，再检查版本，如果版本不匹配，说明bthread失效了。注意：这只是大概的说法，在多线程环境下，即使版本相等，bthread仍可能随时失效，在不同的bthread函数中处理方法都是不同的，有些函数会加锁，有些则能忍受版本不相等。\n这种id生成方式在brpc中应用广泛，brpc中的SocketId，bthread_id_t也是用类似的方法分配的。\n栈 使用ResourcePool加快创建的副作用是：一个pool中所有bthread的栈必须是一样大的。这似乎限制了用户的选择，不过基于我们的观察，大部分用户并不关心栈的具体大小，而只需要两种大小的栈：尺寸普通但数量较少，尺寸小但数量众多。所以我们用不同的pool管理不同大小的栈，用户可以根据场景选择。两种栈分别对应属性BTHREAD_ATTR_NORMAL（栈默认为1M）和BTHREAD_ATTR_SMALL（栈默认为32K）。用户还可以指定BTHREAD_ATTR_LARGE，这个属性的栈大小和pthread一样，由于尺寸较大，bthread不会对其做caching，创建速度较慢。server默认使用BTHREAD_ATTR_NORMAL运行用户代码。\n栈使用mmap分配，bthread还会用mprotect分配4K的guard page以检测栈溢出。由于mmap+mprotect不能超过max_map_count（默认为65536），当bthread非常多后可能要调整此参数。另外当有很多bthread时，内存问题可能不仅仅是栈，也包括各类用户和系统buffer。\ngoroutine在1.3前通过segmented stacks动态地调整栈大小，发现有hot split问题后换成了变长连续栈（类似于vector resizing，只适合内存托管的语言）。由于bthread基本只会在64位平台上使用，虚存空间庞大，对变长栈需求不明确。加上segmented stacks的性能有影响，bthread暂时没有变长栈的计划。\n","excerpt":"内存管理总是程序中的重要一环，在多线程时代，一个好的内存分配大都在如下两点间权衡：\n线程间竞争少。内存分配的粒度大都比较小，对性能敏感，如果不同的线程在大多数分配时会竞争同一份资源或同一把锁，性能将会

Call request.XXX() to add an operation, where XXX is Set in this example. Multiple operations inside a request are sent to a memcached server together (often referred to as \u0026ldquo;pipeline mode\u0026rdquo;). call response.PopXXX() to pop result of an operation from the response, where XXX is Set in this example. true is returned on success, and false otherwise in which case use response.LastError() to get the error message. XXX must match the corresponding operation in the request, otherwise the pop is rejected. In above example, a PopGet would fail with the error message of \u0026ldquo;not a GET response\u0026rdquo;. Results of Pop are independent from the RPC result. Even if \u0026ldquo;a value cannot be put into the memcached\u0026rdquo;, the RPC may still be successful.

当很多线程争抢同一把锁时，一些线程无法立刻获得锁，而必须睡眠直到某个线程退出临界区。这个争抢过程我们称之为contention。在多核机器上，当多个线程需要操作同一个资源却被一把锁挡住时，便无法充分发挥多个核心的并发能力。现代OS通过提供比锁更底层的同步原语，使得无竞争锁完全不需要系统调用，只是一两条wait-free，耗时10-20ns的原子操作，非常快。而锁一旦发生竞争，一些线程就要陷入睡眠，再次醒来触发了OS的调度代码，代价至少为3-5us。所以让锁尽量无竞争，让所有线程“一起飞”是需要高性能的server的永恒话题。\nr31906后brpc支持contention profiler，可以分析在等待锁上花费了多少时间。等待过程中线程是睡着的不会占用CPU，所以contention profiler中的时间并不是cpu时间，也不会出现在cpu profiler中。cpu profiler可以抓到特别频繁的锁（以至于花费了很多cpu），但耗时真正巨大的临界区往往不是那么频繁，而无法被cpu profiler发现。**contention profiler和cpu profiler好似互补关系，前者分析等待时间（被动），后者分析忙碌时间。**还有一类由用户基于condition或sleep发起的主动等待时间，无需分析。\n目前contention

posix系统能以signal方式告知timer触发，不过signal逼迫我们使用全局变量，写async-signal-safe的函数，在面向用户的编程框架中，我们应当尽力避免使用signal。linux自2.6.27后能以fd方式通知timer触发，这个fd可以放到epoll中和传输数据的fd统一管理。唯一问题是：这是个系统调用，且我们不清楚它在多线程下的表现。\n为什么这么关注timer的开销?让我们先来看一下RPC场景下一般是怎么使用timer的：\n在发起RPC过程中设定一个timer，在超时时间后取消还在等待中的RPC。几乎所有的RPC调用都有超时限制，都会设置这个timer。 RPC结束前删除timer。大部分RPC都由正常返回的response导致结束，timer很少触发。 你注意到了么，在RPC中timer更像是”保险机制”，在大部分情况下都不会发挥作用，自然地我们希望它的开销越小越好。一个几乎不触发的功能需要两次系统调用似乎并不理想。那在应用框架中一般是如何实现timer的呢？谈论这个问题需要区分“单线程”和“多线程”:\n在单线程框架中，比如以libevent, libev为代表的eventloop类库，或以GNU Pth, StateThreads为代表的coroutine / fiber类库中，一般是以小顶堆记录触发时间。epoll_wait前以堆顶的时间计算出参数timeout的值，如果在该时间内没有其他事件，epoll_wait也会醒来，从堆中弹出已超时的元素，调用相应的回调函数。整个框架周而复始地这么运转，timer的建立，等待，删除都发生在一个线程中。只要所有的回调都是非阻塞的，且逻辑不复杂，这套机制就能提供基本准确的timer。不过就像Threading Overview中说的那样，这不是RPC的场景。 在多线程框架中，任何线程都可能被用户逻辑阻塞较长的时间，我们需要独立的线程实现timer，这种线程我们叫它TimerThread。一个非常自然的做法，就是使用用锁保护的小顶堆。当一个线程需要创建timer时，它先获得锁，然后把对应的时间插入堆，如果插入的元素成为了最早的，唤醒TimerThread。TimerThread中的逻辑和单线程类似，就是等着堆顶的元素超时，如果在等待过程中有更早的时间插入了，自己会被插入线程唤醒，而不会睡过头。这个方法的问题在于每个timer都需要竞争一把全局锁，操作一个全局小顶堆，就像在其他文章中反复谈到的那样，这会触发cache bouncing。同样数量的timer操作比单线程下的慢10倍是非常正常的，尴尬的是这些timer基本不触发。 我们重点谈怎么解决多线程下的问题。\n一个惯例思路是把timer的需求散列到多个TimerThread，但这对TimerThread效果不好。注意我们上面提及到了那个“制约因素”：一旦插入的元素是最早的，要唤醒TimerThread。假设TimerThread足够多，以至于每个timer都散列到独立的TimerThread，那么每次它都要唤醒那个TimerThread。 “唤醒”意味着触发linux的调度函数，触发上下文切换。在非常流畅的系统中，这个开销大约是3-5微秒，这可比抢锁和同步cache还慢。这个因素是提高TimerThread扩展性的一个难点。多个TimerThread减少了对单个小顶堆的竞争压力，但同时也引入了更多唤醒。\n另一个难点是删除。一般用id指代一个Timer。通过这个id删除Timer有两种方式：1.抢锁，通过一个map查到对应timer在小顶堆中的位置，定点删除，这个map要和堆同步维护。2.通过id找到Timer的内存结构，做个标记，留待TimerThread自行发现和删除。第一种方法让插入逻辑更复杂了，删除也要抢锁，线程竞争更激烈。第二种方法在小顶堆内留了一大堆已删除的元素，让堆明显变大，插入和删除都变慢。\n第三个难点是TimerThread不应该经常醒。一个极端是TimerThread永远醒着或以较高频率醒过来（比如每1ms醒一次），这样插入timer的线程就不用负责唤醒了，然后我们把插入请求散列到多个堆降低竞争，问题看似解决了。但事实上这个方案提供的timer精度较差，一般高于2ms。你得想这个TimerThread怎么写逻辑，它是没法按堆顶元素的时间等待的，由于插入线程不唤醒，一旦有更早的元素插入，TimerThread就会睡过头。它唯一能做的是睡眠固定的时间，但这和现代OS scheduler的假设冲突：频繁sleep的线程的优先级最低。在linux下的结果就是，即使只sleep很短的时间，最终醒过来也可能超过2ms，因为在OS看来，这个线程不重要。一个高精度的TimerThread有唤醒机制，而不是定期醒。\n另外，更并发的数据结构也难以奏效，感兴趣的同学可以去搜索\u0026quot;concurrent priority queue\u0026quot;或\u0026quot;concurrent skip list\u0026quot;，这些数据结构一般假设插入的数值较为散开，所以可以同时修改结构内的不同部分。但这在RPC场景中也不成立，相互竞争的线程设定的时间往往聚集在同一个区域，因为程序的超时大都是一个值，加上当前时间后都差不多。\n这些因素让TimerThread的设计相当棘手。由于大部分用户的qps较低，不足以明显暴露这个扩展性问题，在r31791前我们一直沿用“用一把锁保护的TimerThread”。TimerThread是brpc在默认配置下唯一的高频竞争点，这个问题是我们一直清楚的技术债。随着brpc在高qps系统中应用越来越多，是时候解决这个问题了。r31791后的TimerThread解决了上述三个难点，timer操作几乎对RPC性能没有影响，我们先看下性能差异。\n在示例程序example/mutli_threaded_echo_c++中，r31791后TimerThread相比老TimerThread在24核E5-2620上（超线程），以50个bthread同步发送时，节省4%cpu（差不多1个核），qps提升10%左右；在400个bthread同步发送时，qps从30万上升到60万。新TimerThread的表现和完全关闭超时时接近。\n那新TimerThread是如何做到的？\n一个TimerThread而不是多个。 创建的timer散列到多个Bucket以降低线程间的竞争，默认13个Bucket。 Bucket内不使用小顶堆管理时间，而是链表 + nearest_run_time字段，当插入的时间早于nearest_run_time时覆盖这个字段，之后去和全局nearest_run_time（和Bucket的nearest_run_time不同）比较，如果也早于这个时间，修改并唤醒TimerThread。链表节点在锁外使用ResourcePool分配。 删除时通过id直接定位到timer内存结构，修改一个标志，timer结构总是由TimerThread释放。 TimerThread被唤醒后首先把全局nearest_run_time设置为几乎无限大(max of int64)，然后取出所有Bucket内的链表，并把Bucket的nearest_run_time设置为几乎无限大(max of int64)。TimerThread把未删除的timer插入小顶堆中维护，这个堆就它一个线程用。在每次运行回调或准备睡眠前都会检查全局nearest_run_time， 如果全局更早，说明有更早的时间加入了，重复这个过程。 这里勾勒了TimerThread的大致工作原理，工程实现中还有不少细节问题，具体请阅读timer_thread.h和timer_thread.cpp。\n这个方法之所以有效：\nBucket锁内的操作是O(1)的，就是插入一个链表节点，临界区很小。节点本身的内存分配是在锁外的。 由于大部分插入的时间是递增的，早于Bucket::nearest_run_time而参与全局竞争的timer很少。 参与全局竞争的timer也就是和全局nearest_run_time比一下，临界区很小。 和Bucket内类似，极少数Timer会早于全局nearest_run_time并去唤醒TimerThread。唤醒也在全局锁外。 删除不参与全局竞争。 TimerThread自己维护小顶堆，没有任何cache bouncing，效率很高。 TimerThread醒来的频率大约是RPC超时的倒数，比如超时=100ms，TimerThread一秒内大约醒10次，已经最优。 至此brpc在默认配置下不再有全局竞争点，在400个线程同时运行时，profiling也显示几乎没有对锁的等待。\n下面是一些和linux下时间管理相关的知识：\nepoll_wait的超时精度是毫秒，较差。pthread_cond_timedwait的超时使用timespec，精度到纳秒，一般是60微秒左右的延时。 出于性能考虑，TimerThread使用wall-time，而不是单调时间，可能受到系统时间调整的影响。具体来说，如果在测试中把系统时间往前或往后调一个小时，程序行为将完全undefined。未来可能会让用户选择单调时间。 在cpu支持nonstop_tsc和constant_tsc的机器上，brpc和bthread会优先使用基于rdtsc的cpuwide_time_us。那两个flag表示rdtsc可作为wall-time使用，不支持的机器上会转而使用较慢的内核时间。我们的机器（Intel Xeon系列）大都有那两个flag。rdtsc作为wall-time使用时是否会受到系统调整时间的影响，未测试不清楚。

For example, it could be the replica or snapshot transmitting between different nodes in a distributed system. Although we could send data segmentation across multiple RPC between client and server, this will introduce the following problems:\nIf these RPCs are parallel, there is no guarantee on the order of the data at the receiving side, which leads to complicate code of reassembling. If these RPCs are serial, we have to endure the latency of the network RTT for each RPC together with the process time, which is especially unpredictable. In order to allow large packets to flow between client and server like a stream, we provide a new communication model: Streaming RPC. Streaming RPC enables users to establishes Stream which is a user-space connection between client and service. Multiple Streams can share the same TCP connection at the same time. The basic transmission unit on Stream is message. As a result, the sender can continuously write to messages to a Stream, while the receiver can read them out in the order of sending.\nStreaming RPC ensures/provides:\nThe message order at the receiver is exactly the same as that of the sender Boundary for messages Full duplex Flow control Notification on timeout We do not support segment large messages automatically so that multiple Streams on a single TCP connection may lead to Head-of-line blocking problem. Please avoid putting huge data into single message until we provide automatic segmentation.\nFor examples please refer to example/streaming_echo_c++.\nCreate a Stream Currently stream is established by the client only. A new Stream object is created in client and then is used to issues an RPC (through baidu_std protocol) to the specified service. The service could accept this stream by responding to the request without error, thus a Stream is created once the client receives the response successfully. Any error during this process fails the RPC and thus fails the Stream creation. Take the Linux environment as an example, the client creates a socket first (creates a Stream), and then try to establish a connection with the remote side by connect (establish a Stream through RPC). Finally the stream has been created once the remote side accept the request.\nIf the client tries to establish a stream to a server that doesn\u0026rsquo;t support streaming RPC, it will always return failure.\nIn the code we use StreamId to represent a Stream, which is the key ID to pass when reading, writing, closing the Stream.\nstruct StreamOptions // The max size of unconsumed data allowed at remote side. // If |max_buf_size| \u0026lt;= 0, there\u0026#39;s no limit of buf size // default: 2097152 (2M) int max_buf_size; // Notify user when there\u0026#39;s no data for at least |idle_timeout_ms| // milliseconds since the last time that on_received_messages or on_idle_timeout // finished. // default: -1 long idle_timeout_ms; // Maximum messages in batch passed to handler-\u0026gt;on_received_messages // default: 128 size_t messages_in_batch; // Handle input message, if handler is NULL, the remote side is not allowd to // write any message, who will get EBADF on writting // default: NULL StreamInputHandler* handler; }; // [Called at the client side] // Create a Stream at client-side along with the |cntl|, which will be connected // when receiving the response with a Stream from server-side.

There are several ways to achieve this in brpc:\nWhen backend servers can be hung in a naming service Channel opens backup request. Channel sends the request to one of the servers and when the response is not returned after ChannelOptions.backup_request_ms ms, it sends to another server, taking the response that coming back first. After backup_request_ms is set up properly, in most of times only one request should be sent, causing no extra pressure to back-end services.\nRead example/backup_request_c++ as example code. In this example, client sends backup request after 2ms and server sleeps for 20ms on purpose when the number of requests is even to trigger backup request.\nAfter running, the log in client and server is as following. \u0026ldquo;Index\u0026rdquo; is the number of request. After the server receives the first request, it will sleep for 20ms on purpose. Then the client sends the request with the same index. The final delay is not affected by the intentional sleep.\n/rpcz also shows that the client triggers backup request after 2ms and sends the second request.\nChoose proper backup_request_ms You can look the default cdf(Cumulative Distribution Function) graph of latency provided by brpc, or add it by your own. The y-axis of the cdf graph is a latency(us by default), and the x-axis is the proportion of requests whose latencies are less than the corresponding value in y-aixs. In the following graph, Choosing backup_request_ms=2ms could approximately cover 95.5% of the requests, while choosing backup_request_ms=10ms could cover 99.99% of the requests.\nThe way of adding it by yourself:\n#include \u0026lt;bvar/bvar.h\u0026gt; #include \u0026lt;butil/time.h\u0026gt; ... bvar::LatencyRecorder my_func_latency(\u0026#34;my_func\u0026#34;); ... butil::Timer tm; tm.start(); my_func(); tm.stop(); my_func_latency \u0026lt;\u0026lt; tm.u_elapsed(); // u represents for microsecond, and s_elapsed(), m_elapsed(), n_elapsed() correspond to second, millisecond, nanosecond. // All work is done here. My_func_qps, my_func_latency, my_func_latency_cdf and many other counters would be shown in /vars. When backend servers cannot be hung in a naming service [Recommended] Define a SelectiveChannel that sets backup request, in which contains two sub channel. The visiting process of this SelectiveChannel is similar to the above situation. It will visit one sub channel first. If the response is not returned after channelOptions.backup_request_ms ms, then another sub channel is visited. If a sub channel corresponds to a cluster, this method does backups between two clusters. An example of SelectiveChannel can be found in example/selective_echo_c++. More details please refer to the above program.\n[Not Recommended] Issue two asynchronous RPC calls and join them. They cancel each other in their done callback. An example is in example/cancel_c++. The problem of this method is that the program always sends two requests, doubling the pressure to back-end services. It is uneconomical in any sense and should be avoided as much as possible.\n","excerpt":"Sometimes in order to ensure availability, we need to visit two services at the same time and get …","ref":"https://brpc.incubator.apache.org/docs/client/backup-request/","title":"Backup request"},{"body":"If your program only uses client in brpc or doesn\u0026rsquo;t use brpc at all, but you also want to use built-in services in brpc.

Learn More Download bRPC Get started! Why bRPC? bRPC is an open source high performance industrial-grade Remote Procedure Call(RPC) framework, with 1,000,000+ instances(not counting clients) and thousands kinds of services. You can use it to: Build a server that can talk in multiple protocols (on same port), or access all sorts of services. restful http/https, h2/gRPC. using http/h2 in brpc is much more friendly than libcurl. Access protobuf-based protocols with HTTP/h2+json, probably from another language. redis and memcached, thread-safe, more friendly and performant than the official clients. rtmp/flv/hls, for building streaming services. hadoop_rpc (may be opensourced) rdma support (will be opensourced) thrift support, thread-safe, more friendly and performant than the official clients. all sorts of protocols used in Baidu: baidu_std, streaming_rpc, hulu_pbrpc, sofa_pbrpc, nova_pbrpc, public_pbrpc, ubrpc and nshead-based ones. Build HA distributed services using an industrial-grade implementation of RAFT consensus algorithm which is opensourced at braft Servers can handle requests synchronously or asynchronously. Clients can access servers synchronously, asynchronously, semi-synchronously, or use combo channels to simplify sharded or parallel accesses declaratively. Debug services via http, and run cpu, heap and contention profilers. Get better latency and throughput. Extend brpc with the protocols used in your organization quickly, or customize components, including naming services (dns, zk, etcd), load balancers (rr, random, consistent hashing) bRPC is an Apache incubation project.
